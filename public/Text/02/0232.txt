Distance-wise Prevalence of Respiratory ImpairlDent In Fetnale Population
The prevalence of obstructive, restrictive and combined restrictive-cum-obstructive ventilatory
impairment in female population exposed to MIC gas staying at various distances from the Union
Carbide factory is shown in Table 19.
The highest overall prevalence of respiratory impairment was recorded in the study sample
which lived in close proximity to the factory area i.e. 0-1 km and the lowest prevalence (35.0~~) was
observed in those who lived between 1-2 km from the factory.
Those who lived farthest
(4-5 km) from the factory showed 50.0~·~ pulmonary abnormality.
Obstructive lung impairment was most prominently (6.2l!~) seen in the study population
which lived at a distance of 3-4 km from the M IC producing factory in contrast to the lung restriction
which showed its maximal prevalence (14.8~!o) in the females who lived 2-3 km from the factory
premises, while the lowest prevalence of obstruction (1.6°~) and restriction (3.2%) was recorded
in the population who resided between 1-2 km from the factory. In contrast to this the combined
pulmonary disorder affected females most (35.0~/~) living farthest from the UCIL plant and its
minimum occurrence (25.3~~) was recorded in the female cases who stayed 1-2 km from the MIC
plant. Thus it can be seen from Table 19 that female population classified according to the distance from their place of living to the factory did not reveal any definite pattern of various
respiratory disorders.
Distance-wise distribution of pulmonary obstruction in the female populatiqn is shown in
Table 20.
The results indicated the highest prevalence (5.0 0 ~) of mild airway obstruction in
those who lived 0-1 km from the factory area while its lowest prevalence (1.1 O~) was reported in the female population staying 2-3 km away. Moderate bronchial obstruction was recorded
in 3 (0.7 %) cases; 2 (1.06~·~) cases which lived at a distance of 2-3 km and 1 (1.2°~) case stayed
3-4 kh1 from the factory. Severe obstruction in the lungs was noticed only in one 1 (0.5~~) case
who lived 2.:3 km from the UCll plant.
