Identification

Remarks

Amines?

Individual identification could not be done

Expt 10

Amine
MMA nor DMA

The peak was identified as TMA by GC/Ms

Expt II

TMA

Comparison with aq.solution of TMA was done.

Expt 12

2

TMA (minor)
Acetone (major)

Acetone is from solvent used

Expt 13

2

TMA (major)
Acetone (minor)

Poor concentration of the sample.

Expt 14

3

Not identified
TMA
Acetone (Tr)

GC/MS was carried out. But only one peak corresponding to TMA was obtained concentration
was also poor.

Expt 15

3

Not identified

Peak (1) was found to be neutral by chemical
treatment and the presence of CO was dete'cted
2
by IR also. HCN is ruled out.

Expt 16

3

Not identified
TMA
Acetone (Tr)

Peak no.(1) disappeared after 4 days. CO is
suspected at this stage.

Expt 15 B

2

CO
TMA

(I) was confirmed by comparison with pure CO

CO
TMA

Peak (I) was confirmed by comparison with pure
CO and later by Mr Salvapathi.

Expt 17

2

and later by GC analysis of gas in the coal
division (Mr Salvapathi).

GC conditions:
Column: 12' 1/8" SS column, 396'Carbowax 2% KOH coated on chromosorb WAW.
Column temp: 30°C, Injector temp: 100°C, Detector (FID) temp: 100°C
Carrier gas (N2) flow: 6-8 ml/mt.
