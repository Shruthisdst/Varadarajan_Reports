its highest prevalence (20.8 0/ 0 ) in those who lived close by i. e. between 0-1 km distance from the
Union Carbide factory at Bhopal. The lowest prevalence (10.7 0/ 0 ) of the combined pulmonary
defect was observed in those who lived at a distance of 1-2 km from the factory site. like restrictive lung disorder it also failed to establish any correl3tion between its prevalence and the various
distance groups.
The overall prevalence of respiratory impairment (obstructive, restrictive and the combined
restrictive-cum-obstructive) was maximally (41.5'Yo) observed in those males who stayed in the
vicinity of the factory i.e. 0-1 km while its minimum prevalence (22.6%) was recorded in the study
sample staying between 3-4 km from the factory. However, overall prevalence of repiratory impairment did not show any definite trend with respact to various distance groups in which male
population was broadly classified.
The distribution of prevalence of mild, moderate and severe obstructive syndrome in
different distance groups in the male popuiation is shown in Table 16. The highest prevalence
(9.1 %) of mild pulmonary obstruction was seen in those who lived very close to the· factory
(0-1 km) and the lowest prevalence (1.9%) was reported in those who lived between 2-3 km from
the factory. However, mild respiratory obstruction did not observe any significant correlation
with the various distance groups. The moderate bronchial obstruction was conspicuously absent
in the present male population studied whereas there was only 1 case (0.6%) reported for the
severe obstructive syndrome staying between 2-3 km from the MIC producing factory.
The overall prevalence of obstructive ventilatory defect was maximally (9.1 %) reported ;n'
the male population which stayed very close to the factory area (0-1 km) and the minimum (1.5%)
was found in those who Iiv€d between 1-2 km from the factory area. The overall prevalence of
bronchial obstruction also failed to correlate with the various distance groups.
