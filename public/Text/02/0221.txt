male population revealed significant difference (p<O.05) in the prevalence of ventilatory ob3tructive
abnormality, latter being more affected (5.7%) in contrast to non-smokers (1.6<J'o)Â·
In case of restrictive lung disease, 105 (13.4%) exhibited its overall prevalence in the study
population, being insignificantly different between the male (14.8%) and female (12.1 %) cases.
Similarly, smoking-wise no significant difference could be, seen in the prevalence of restrictive airway
abnormality. Thus it was noted that the restrictive pattern of ventilatory defect was found to be
independent of smoking habit.
The combined obstructive-cum-restrictive ventilatory defect was observed in 174 (22.2%)
cases out of 783 cases who performed spirometry. It is clear from Table 3 that its prevalence was
significantly higher (28.3%) in the female population in comparison to (15.3%) observed in the
male population (p<0.005). Here also we were unable to mark any significant influence of smoking on the prevalenc~ of mixed ventilatory abnormality.
The spirometric findings revealed that 60.6 % cases had normal values of spirometry
while 39.40/0 showed impaired values of various pulmonary functions.
It can be derived from Table 3 that among the types of respiratory impairment observed in
the study population, the combined restrictive-cum-obstructive ventilatory syndrome was the most
prevalent as a result of methyl isocyanate gas action on the human lung followed by restrictive
pattern of the disease.
The details of obstructive pulmonary abnormality in the study population are described in
Table 4. The overall prevalence of mild airway obstruction was noted in 3.0% population out of
783 cases studied.
Mild bronchial obstruction was reported in 3.5% male population in
comparison to 2.6% observed in the female population. This shows that sex-wise there was no significant difference observed in the prevalence of mild obstructive syndrome. Smoking revealed a
significant effect on the prevalence of bronchial obstruction as smok~rs exhibited significantly higher
prevalence (5.7%,) of mild obstruction in the lungs in comparison to 1.1 % noted in the non-smoking
male population (p<0.5). Not a single case of moderate ventilatory obstruction was observed in the
male population 'studied. In contrast to this the female population showed 0.7% cases affected by
this category of obstruction. The overall prevalence of moderate airway obstruction was reported
only in 0.3% cases in the whole population studied.
The overall severe ventilatory obstruction was reported in 0.2% cases in the study population. Sex-wise, it was seen that male and female population were equally affected by severe
bronchospasm (0.2%). Among the non-smoking mala population only 1 case (0.5% ) showed
the evidence of severe airway constriction while there was no case in the smoking population.
Thus it can be seen from the Table 4 that the reported bronchial obstruction was predominantly mild in nature in the methyl isocya nate gas affected population of Bhopal.
