CHEMICAL STUDIES ON MIC
AND
DESIGN AND ENGINEERING OF RRL SCIENTISTS
1986

The report of the Regional Research Laboratory, Hyderabad (RRL-H), gives, in Part I, details of
the experimental evidence of chemical transformation which took place in the illÂ·fated MIC tank.
It includes results of experimental simulation of conditions prevailing in the tank during the accident. Predetermined proportions of MIC, chloroform and water were subjected to arious conditions
and the products identified. Presence of large quantities of carbon dioxide and relatively smaller
fractions of trimethyl amine in the gaseous products has proved to be significant in confirming the
sequence of reactions postulated earlier by the Report on Scientific Studies on the Factors related
to Bhopal Toxic Gas Leakage of December 1985. Similarly, the presence of certain constituents
of the residue has re-affirmed the dependence of the reactions on the pressure prevailing in the tank.
Part II deals with the efforts of the Design and Engineering group of RRL.
RRL scientists were involved right from the beginning in the investigations and the subsequent safe disposal of MIC during "Operation Faith". Later they visited the VCIL premises in
order to carry out various assigned tasks, including sampling of the residue, weighing of the tank,
examination of the engineering documents for assessing the adequacy of design and operation of
the MIC plant, etc. Various hypotheses proposed to explain the sequence of events prior to the
incident were also scrutinized by studying in detail the design specifications of the plant and
equipment and the prevailing operating conditions.
RRLH scientists assisted the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the lawyels by providing clarifications to specific questions raised by them on the design and engineering aspects of the
MIC process plant. Some results of the above could also be found in the concluding paragraphs.
