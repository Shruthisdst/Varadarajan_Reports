Population

The physical characteristics of the male and female population studied for lung function
are detalled in Table 1. The mean age of the male population was found to be 33.8 ± 0.60 years
(±SEM) while female population was slightly younger (mean age 32.9 ±O.55 years). Thus it was
seen that sexwise there was no significant difference observed between the male and female population drawn at random for the present study (p<0.05). Among the male population, howaver
there existed the age difference between non-smokers and smokers. Smokers were significantly
older than the non-smokers (p<O.OOl). Simi/ary the height also differed between the two groups
(p<0.05) thereby revealing that non-smoking male population was taller than their smoking
No significant difference could
be
observed in their respective weights.
coun'.. erparts.
The mean anthropometric measurement of methyl isocyanate gas exposed pop~ulation
affected by pulmonary impairment is presented in Table 2.
The male population which suffered
from obstructive, restrictive and combined restrictive cum obstructive ventilatory defects did not
differ significantly in their mean age. Similarly, the female populatioo also did not reveal any age
difference except in those who were affected by obstructive and mixed ventilatory impairment
(p<0.01). Female population with combined spirometric abnormality was older than those with
obstructive or rest~ictiv.e ventilatory insufficiencies. The mean distance from the UCIl factory did
not differ significantty in the male or female population affected by pulmonary impairment.

Prevalence Of Respiratory Impairment In The Study Population
The prevalence of ventilatory impairment in the male and female population is shown in
Table 3. The ov€rc.1I prevalence of ventilatory impairmant was found to be 33.9% in the male
population in contrast to 44.1 'Yo obsc;rved in female population, which was slightly higher
