INVESTIGATIONS ON STAINLESS STEEL
PLATES FROM METHYL ISOCYANATE
TANKS NO. EÂ·61 0 AND E-611 OF
UNION CARBIDE PLANT AT BHOPAL

INTRODUCTION
Following the accident in December 1984 at
the Union Carbide Plant at Bhopal, National
Aeronautical Laboratory was requested to
carry out metallurgical investigations on samples
cut from the stainless steel tanks No.610 and
611 in which methyl isocyanate had been
stored prior to the accident. The tank 610
removed from its mound is shown in Fig. 1.
It is about 2.5 m in diameter and 12 m long,
made of stainless steel plates of 8mm thickness
along the straight portion and about 10 rom
at the dished ends. Tank 611 is said to be similar to tank 610. Specimens cut from the dished
end and also from the barrel at various locations as shown in Fig. 2, were supplied for
laboratory examination.

the external surface of the tank. There was no
evidence of burning or charring of the bitumen
coating. The soil sticking to the bitumen was
loose and showed no evidence of sintering.
These observations suggest that the tank had not
been exposed to very high temperatures.
In tank 610, there was a strongly adhering
dark deposit on the inner surface of the plate
cut from the top of the tank. Colourless crystalline material was also present on this deposit.
Fig. 3 shows the appearance of these deposits_
The plates cut from the dished end and from the
sides of the tank had similar deposits but the
amount of crystalline deposits was more and
they had slight greenish tinge.
In the samples from tank 611 sent to NAL,
there were no such deposits on the inner surface.
However, there was a brownish stain at a few
locations as shown in Fig. 4.

VISUAL EXAMINATION
When tank 610 was removed from its mound,
it was found that its external surface had a
coating of bitumen with fibre reinforcement.
After peeling the coating, the tank surface was
examined. There were no signs of corrosion on
