It may be noted that except for the differences
in the DMU and DMI concentrations, all others

are fairly agreeing. Taking into account that the
tank residues are likely to have formed at a
pressure of 11-13 kg/cm 2 g and 250o C, the
discrepancy noted suggests that the reactions of
MIC are influenced by pressure. A rough calculation on this basis shows that the pressure of
the reaction in experiment 14 should be around
1.25 kg/cm 2g which is just one tenth of the
pressure experienced by the tank 610. Expt 17
was a repetition of experiment 8 of the article in
J. Org. Chem., 51, 3781 (1986) to appreciate
the replication of the results. A comparison
of the area percentages of the products is given
below, as weight percentages are not quoted in
the paper.

1. Experiments with different proportions of
water and chloroform in the selected ranges
3-8% for water and 3-6% for chloroform
were carried out at 250°C and gases collected were analysed.
2. Besides large amounts of carbon dioxide,
trimethyl amine was identified in all experiments irrespective of whether chloroform was added or not.

3. The identification of trimethyl amine helped
to confirm the reaction sequences. DMA
and TMA have been postulated to arise from
the decomposition of the reaction products
ofMIC.
4. The identification of carbon monoxide in
experiments involving chloroform showed
that it might have formed through formic
acid.
5. The analysis of the acetone soluble residues
suggested the possible dependance of the
reactions on the pressure of the reaction.

Personnel involved in the work

The estimated pressure in experiment 8 is
around 2.04 kg}cm 2g which is twice the pressure
in experiment 14. Here again, it is seen that
DMU and DMI are the substances that exhibit
large differences. The inference that the pressure of 1.25 kg}cm 2g in experiment 17 and the
pressure of 2.04 kg/cm 2g in experiment 8 (J.
Org. Chem.) bear a relationship for the respective formation of DMI suggests that a systematic
study of the influence of pressure on this reaction has to be done to achieve the replication
of the chemistry of the products formed in the
tank 610.
