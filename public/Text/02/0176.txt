ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE

1. Take 0, 0.95, 1.90, 2.85, 3.80 ml of standard isocyanate solution in heating tubes
and dilute to 10 ml with absorbing solution (this corresponds to 0, 5, 10, 15 and
20 ug of isocyanates).

Heating tubes: Glass tubes (30 ml cap.) with
stopper and tapered at the bottom.

2. Neutralise the solutions in the tubes with
5.0 ml of 4.0 M sodium hydroxide solution.

Water bath: Thermostat for constant heating

3. Add 1.5 ml of sodium borate by pipette
and mix.

Separating funnels: 30 ml cap. for separating
the organic layer.
REAGENTS

4. Add 0.1 rol of 0.3% 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene solution and again mix.
5. Heat the tubes for 15 minutes at 750 C in a
thermostatic water bath.

Standard sodium hydroxide solution: 4 M and
6. Remove the tubes and cool for 5 minutes.

Absorbing solution: Dilute 36 ml of conca HCI
to 100 ml with distilled water. Mix 50 ml of
the resulting solution with 50 ml of dimethyl
sulfoxide (DI\lS0).

Sodium borate buffer solution: Dissolve 30.0 gm
of boric acid in 700 ml of distilled water. Add
slowly, while stirring, 4.0 M sodium hydroxide
solution until the pH is 8.8, as indicated by a pH
meter.

Next add 5.0 ml of 0.1 M sodium hydroxide
solution and mix.
7. Add 3.0 ml of CC14 by pipette (using rubber
bulb) in each tube. Mix the contents of the
tube for one minute and transfer the liquid
to 30 ml separating funnel, allow the two
phases to separate.
8. Take the organic layer in a 5 ml volume
flask.
