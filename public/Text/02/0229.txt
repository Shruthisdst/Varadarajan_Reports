any definite correlation with the different distance groups. The restrictive pattern of lung disorder
maximally (23.00/0) affected male population residing 1-2 km from the factory area while minimum
prevalence (5.6%) was observed in those who stayed 3-4 km from the UCIL Plant. The preva
lence of resttictive lung disease also failed to show any correlation with the various distance groups
in which the study male population was grouped. The mixed variety of ventilatory impairment showed
