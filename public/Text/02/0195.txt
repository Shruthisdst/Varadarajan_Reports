BHOPAL DISASTER
A FOLLOW UP STUDY PHASE I & II

1986

The report on phase I and II follow up studies conducted by the Indian Toxicology Research Centre
(ITRC), Lucknow is contained in the following pages. ITRC established a small follow-up Study
Centre at Bhopal, which began operating on 14 February 1985, to monitor various clinical parameters of the gas-victims. About 687 patients were examined during the phase 1. Systematic investigations for studying ten different parameters involving history, clinical examination, chest X-rays,
lung function tests, haematological, behavioural immunological biochemical studies and chromosomal conditions were undertaken. Phase II commenced from 18th March 1985 and lasted for three
more weeks.
The data presented, particularly those showing various abnormal physiological functions in
the population group studied by ITRC are indicative of various deleterious effects which appear
to have been caused due to exposure to the toxic gas. All the people had complained about signs
and symptoms which had a great degree of similarity indicating that they were exposed to similar
type of toxic gas. Therefore, the signs and symptoms and after-effects recorded in the study appear
to be related to their exposure to methyl isocyanate gas and any others produced and released after
the run-away reaction in the storage tank of methyl isocynate.
