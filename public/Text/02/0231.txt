Table 17 presents the prevalence of mild rastriction in the lungs in the male population in
the various distance groups. The highest prevalence (24.6(':,) was recorded in the population which
lived between 1-2 km from the factory area while the minimum prevalence (7 .5° 0) was reported
in those who stayed 3-4 km away from the factory. The mild restrictive pattern of the lung dis9ase
did not correlate well with various distance groups so as to give a definite trend between its prevalence and the different distance groups in which the male population was classified.
The distribution of prevalence of mixed ventilatory impairm3nt .in various distance groups
in the male population is shown in (Table 18). The ovarall prevalence of combined ventilatory
defect ranged from 11.3% in the 3-4 km distance groups. The minimum prevalence (5.3%) of
mild mixed pulmonary abnormality was observed in the male population living farthest (4-5 km)
from the factory area whereas its maximum prevalence (12.7 % ) was revealed by those who lived
between 2-3 km distance from the UCIL plant. However, no correlation betwaen its prevalence
and the distance from the factory to living areas could be ascertained in the mild mixed variety of
the lung disorder.
In case of moderate degree of combined ventilatory defect, the minimum prevalence (1.9%) was observed in the male population which lived 2-3 km from the factory whi1e
population which stayed very close to factory revealed its maximal incidence (3.8°,~). Male population which stayed farthest from the factory (4-5 km) showed the highest prevalence (10.5%) of
severe form of mixed respiratory abnormality while population living within 2-3 km from the
factory were· least (1.2~/~) affected by the severe combined ventilatory defect. The spirometric
results, however, did not show any definite correlation between the prevalence of moderate or
severe form of combined ventilatory impairment and the various distance groups.
