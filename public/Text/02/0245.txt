The subjects have been divided according to the positive findings in respect of symptomatology, X-ray findings, PFT values, and findings on the clinical examination as follows:

To screen out malingerers, the findings of symptomatology, clinical examination, X-ray
and pulmonary function tests were correlated. Those subjects whose chest X-ray did not show
any abnormality and whose lung function values were normal and where no abnormality was
detected on clinical examination were very strongly suspected to be malingerers giving a false statement of being suffering from respiratory symptoms like cough, breathlessness, pain and/or
tightness in chest etc. for the lure of getting compensation or otherwise their symptoms are psychogenic in nature consequent to the severe tragedy witnessed by them. Such cases need to be
studied in greater detail during follow-up studies.
S.ixty two (6.8%) subjects showed definite radiological findings of tubercular infection.
Out of these, 55 subjects (6.1 (Yo) showed findings of pulmonary tuberculosis and 7 su bjects
(O.77o;~) showed findings of primary complex. The incidence of tubercular infection (6.8%), is
much more as compared to National Tuberculosis Survey finding of 1.8%. Moreover, most of the
X-rays where findings are suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis showed that they are healed cases.
There is a strong possibility that probably the active tuberculosis cases could not withstand the
toxic effects of M IC and could not survive and those with healed tuberculosis could survive.
