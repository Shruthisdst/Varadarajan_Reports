The pattern of overall prevalence of lung restriction was maximally (14.8~~) recorded in
those who lived 2-3 km from the factory and its minimum prevalence (3.1 ~~) was observed in the
1-2 km distance group.
The prevalence of mixed ventilatory impairment in the exposed female population according
to various distance groups is described in Table 22. The farthest living group (4-5 km) from the
UCll plant suffered most (40.0.10) from the overall mixed variety of respiratory impairment in comparison to those who suffered le-ast (24.6%) in the 3-4 km distance group. Among the different
categories of combined ventilatory disorder, the highest prevalence (30.0%) of mild combined
defect was recorded in those who stayed 4-5 km from the pesticide factory while its lowest prevalence (13.50;0) was noticed in the 3-4 km distance group. The moderate category of mixed
ventilatory insufficiency ranged from 6.3% in the 1-2 km distance group to 10.0% in those who lived
between 4-5 km from the Union Carbide factory. The severe mixed spirometric impairment showed
its maximal prevalence (6.3'lCi) in the 1-2 km distance group in contrast to its minimum occurrence
(1.2%) which was recorded in those who Jived 3-4 km from the factory area. Neither the overall nor the various categories of combined pulmonary impairment showed any definite trend in its
prevalence with respect to various distance groups.
