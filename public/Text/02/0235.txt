Pulmonary FUDction Status of M1C Exposed Population
Lung function values in asymptomatic and symptomatic male population exposed to MIC
gas are shown in Table 23. It can be observed from the table that the mean spirometric values
in the male population suffering from various respiratory symptoms (symptom3tic group) were significantly decreased in comparison to those recorded in the asymptomatic male po·pulation. Thus
the mean pulmonary function test viz. FEV o'7[>,FEV l,FEV l/FVC ratio and IMBC expressed as the
percent of the normal predicted values, were considerably impaired in contrast to the corresponding
values observed in the sympt~mless male population. The FEV O'i5(P) revealed a mean value
of 93.50/0 in the symptomatic population which was significantly reduced in comparison to 1 01.3~.~
recorded in the asymptomatic male population (p<O.05). Similar reduction was also recorded with
respect to FEV1 parameter in the affected population (p<0.05) whereas VC and FVC, although
decreased in the symptomatic population in comparison to asymptomatic group, did not reach the
statistical significance. FEV1/FVC ratio was found to be significantly lowered (78.9~~) in the
affected group in contrast to the mea" value (84.4~~) reported in the NAD male population
(p<O.001). Similar trend was also reported in case of IMBC parameter wherein the symptomatic
population revealed a mean value of 96.4% as against 103.9% exhibited by the asymptoma :ic
population.
However, PEFR and AVI showed identical mean values in both the groups
unatfec,ed by the respiratory symptoms induced by MIC exposure in the male population.

The mean residual values and the observed values of pulmonary functions calculated in the
female population are shown in Table 24. The residual values, indicate the
difference
between the recorded absolute values and the reference values derived from the normal predicted
formula. O~ t-he various spirometric functions viz. VC and IMBC were significantly decreased in
the sysptomatic group in comparison to those observed in the symptomless female population. The
mean difference between the observed and predicted values of VC was found to be -0.42 litres in
the symptomatic group which was significantly greater than the mean difference of-0.05 litres recorded in the asymptomatic group (p<O.OO1). Similarly, IMBC revealed three fold greater reduction (-9.3
