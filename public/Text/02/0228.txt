Distance-wise Prevalence Of Respiratory Impairment ID Male PopulatioD
The prevalence of raspiratory impairment in the male population staying at various distances
from the UCIL plant is shown in Table 15. The maximum prevalence (9.1 %) of obstructive pulmonary impairment was observed in the population which stayed very close to the factory i. e. 0-1
km while its minimum incidence was reported in the male population which stayed between 1-2 km
