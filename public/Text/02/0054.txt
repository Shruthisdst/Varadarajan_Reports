were

done:

a) The pyrolysed MIC in sealed ampoule
obtal.lled from Lab-X (pyrolysis was done
at Lab-X at 250 0 C) was dissolved in aqueous
sodium hydroxide according to procedure
described earlier and solution analysed for
CN- ion.

iii) The obvious difference between the two
MIC samples was that E-G11 contained
small quantities of chloroform which possibly acted as a free radical inhibitor during
thermal cracking of MIC to HCN.
Therefore, a small quantity of chloroform was added to Lab-X MIC and thermolysed at 300 o C. No HCN (or almost nil)
was found (see expt. 'f', Table. 4.1.1),
thus confirming that chloroform acted
as an inhibitor.

b) MIC (70 microlitres, Lab-X) was taken in a

glass ampoule, fused and was heated to
300 0 C for 1/2 hr, cooled and the content
was taken in aqueous sodium hydroxide
(25 ml; O.IN).
c) MIC (100 microlitres, Lab-X) was taken in a
glass ampoule, sealed and heated to 3000 e
fof 1./2 hr, cooled and the content was
taken in aqueous sodium hydroxide (29 ml;
O.IN).
d) MIC (104 microlitres, E-611) was similarly
processed as in (b) and (c).
e) MIC (100 microlitres, E-61I) was mixed
with acetylchloride (3 microlitres) in an
ampoule and the ampoule was sealed and
processed as in (b) and (c).

iv) To see if small quantity of acetyl chloride
impurity (the starting material for Lab-X
MIC) could hL\ _ acted as a promoter, 3%
of the same was added to E-611 MIC and
pyrolysed. No HeN was formed.
v) Regarding the level of accuracy in the
estimation of eN-, there was reasonably
good agreement between the 2 methods
of silver nitrate and colorimetry. However,
the ion selective electrode method sometimes gave widely divergent values. Perhaps, some interference by other products
of MIC thermolysis was responsible.

f)

MIC (60 microlitres, Lab-X) was mixed
with chloroform (3 microlitres) in an ampoule and the ampoule was sealed and then
processed as in (b) and (c).

g) MIC (25 microlitres, E-61I) was also taken
in aqueous sodium hydroxide (25 ml; 0.1
h) MIC (25 microlitres, Lab-X) was directly
taken in aqueous sodium hydroxide (25 ml;
O.IN).
The results of the above experiments are
described in Table 4.1.1.

Pyrolysis of MIC at higher temperatures

Since the Bhopal E-611 sample of MIC did
not give any HCN on thermolysis at 300 0 C,
it was subjected to higher temperatures of
350 0 , 400 0 , 4500 , and 5000 C.
Together with the E-611 MIC another
sample of commercial MIC (laboratory reagent grade, Fluka, purity 98%) was also subjected to thermolysis at the same tempera·
tures specified above. The results of these
pyrolysis experiments are given in Table 4.1.2
and 4.1.2 (a).
