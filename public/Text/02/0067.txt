Other curves for different extents of FeC1 3 can

be similarly fitted. The one reported here, how-

ever, is believed to faB in a range that is close to
the FeCl3 contents analysed from the tank and
has been subsequently used in model computation.
No data on MIC-MMA reaction have been
reported. It is known, however, that the MICMMA reaction is much faster than the MICwater reaction. It is expected therefore (especially in the presence of large concentration
of MIC) that the MMA formed due to the reaction of MIC with water will get quickly consumed and the rate of its reaction with MIC will be
dictated by its own availability which is governed by its reaction with water. The nonavailability of MIC-MMA rate data is therefore not a
serious handicap.

Data on common physical and thermophysical properties such as densities and specific heats
of the liquid reactants and products are readily
available in standard references. We additionally
need information regarding the heats of reaction.
These have been estimated by using the heats of
formation and other thermodynamic data. The
procedures used for estimation have been summarised in Appendix-I.
Among other properties of the reactant
mixture, the one of immediate concern to us
here relates to the pertinent vapour pressuretemperature relationship. Based on the analysis
and identification of chemical species present in
the tank, it is reasonable to expect MIC and
chloroform to predominantly contribute to the
vapour pressure exerted and it is important to
establish the vapour pressure-temperature curve
for this systems quantitatively. In addition
water-MIC reaction leads to the generation of
CO 2 , which will also contribute to the total
pressure in the tank.
