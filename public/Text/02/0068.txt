23 Calculation of leakage rates
The information available on the leakage
capacity of the safety valve is somewhat ~ncer­
tain. The available data documents (3) estlmate
the leakage rate MIC from the tank at 40 psig to
be around 10 000 pounds/hr. Even here, the
estimate is ba~ed on the assumption of single
phase flow and complications due to the twophase nature of the system are ignored .. In the
present analysis we have accept~ the basiC leakage rate as estimated for the single phase fl~w
and modified it to take into account the vanations in the pressure and temperature in the
tank. It is of interest to note that both these
parameters are changing with time, the leakage
term is also therefore a variable and is duly
accounted for in the model. As far as the varia-

tions of flow rate through the vent valve is
concerned, we assume that it increases as squareroot of pressure in the tank. The effect of temperature is little more involved, in that the temperature affects the Reynolds number of the escaping tluid due to the variation of densities and
viscosities and the Reynolds number in tum
affects the coefficients of discharge. The leakage
term is therefore appended properly to take care
of such variations and the coefficient of discharge is evaluated from the generalised Cd-R
e
relationship (4).
In an alternative method, one can rely on
the recent experimental investigations of twophase flow in connection with vent sizing exercises (5). The analysis of experiments leads to
the following empirical correlation, which can
be used for calculating the discharge rates:

vessel, other parameters in this equation are
time dependent. The mass flux is also therefore
time dependent.
The literature data on two-phase systemh
also indicate that the two-phase critical flow rate

where the quantities in square bracket refer to
the self heat rates of the set temperature and
maximum temperature in the system. The
advantage of relations given by equations (8) to
(10) is obvious in that one does not require any
explicit information regarding the kinetics of the
system. In the present calculations both the
alternatives have been employed and they seem
to yield results which agree with each other
reasonably well.
