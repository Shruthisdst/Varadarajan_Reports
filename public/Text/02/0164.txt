10.2 Emergency Response Systems - Approach

vii)

Knowredge of possible protective and
remedial measures;

A sizeable number of chemical compounds that
are being handled today are highly toxic to
humans and their environment, and the accidental release of small amounts of such substances into environment may have extremely
serious consequences. Hence a preplanned procedure for handling major and minor emergencies, arising out of chemical accidents, which
utilise the combined resources of local, national
and international services including all available
technical and scientific information is being
developed and updated as well as practised in
all the industrialised countries. Having recognised the need for such contingency planning
the World Health Organization, EDRO, Copenhagen under 'Health Aspects of Chemical
Safety' has brought out an Interim Document
entitled "Emergency Response to Chemical
Accidents - 1981". A brief outline of the approach suggested in the interim document
'Planning Emergency Response Systems for
Chemical Accidents' is presented and discussed
for suitable modification if necessary and
adoption to Indian context (Annexure 9).

10.3 To meet any emergency due to chemical
accidents, it may be necessary that sustained
efforts are made and continued at CSIR level
to develop suitable emergency systems. This
may necessitate consideration of the following:

The above aspects are necessary to develop
structure and elements of emergency response
systems", The four levels of Emergency Planning
Contingency plan for chemical accident identified and suggested in the WHO document
referred are given in Annexure 10.

lOA In order that NEERI can play a more
effective role in meeting environmental aspects
of chemical accidents, the Institute has to
develop and strengthen capabilities in the
following areas :
i)
Estimation of possible chemical emissions
from selected industries handling and/or
producing toxic or hazardous chemicals;
ii)

Monitoring of air, water and soil for specific pollutants with hazardous potential;

iii)

Assistance in information dissemination
of effects on toxic and/or hazardous
chemicals;

i)

Investigation of vulnerable points, processes and/or activities;

iv)

Provide action teams to assist in monitoring items (i) and (ii) indicated above;

ii)

Estimation of possible chemical emissions;

v)

Competence build-up for spillage handling; and

iii)

Knowledge of effects of toxic chemicals;
vi)

iv)

Identification of chemical industries using
raw materials, intermediates and prodUCIng end products which are known to
be potentially hazardous. To begin with
large and medium scale industries should
be included in the survey;

Safe disposal of toxic and/or hazardous
wastes.

v)

\66

Development of analytical capabilities for
identification and assaying of various
toxic and hazardous chemicals used in
chemical industries;

NEERI can also actively participate in
drawing up emergency response systems, for
handling chemical accidents, in collaboration
with other agencies which will be working in
this area.
