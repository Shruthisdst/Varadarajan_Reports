The prevalence of lung restriction in femal~ p~pulation classified into various distance
groups is presented in Table 21, The mild form of restrictive disorder ranged from 3.1 % in the
1-2 km group to 13.3% in those who lived close by within a radius of 0-1 km. Moderate cases of
restriction (1.5%) were observed only in those females who lived between 2-3 km from the
UCIL industry. While路 severe restrictive disorder was detected in 5 (1.2 ~/o) cases, 3 (1.5~~) were
affected in t~e 2-3 km distance group and 2 (2.4(10) cases were found in thQse who lived 3-4 km
from the factory premises.
Mild restrictive ventilatory abnormality observed in the female popu路
lation did not exhibit any correlation with the various distance groups.
