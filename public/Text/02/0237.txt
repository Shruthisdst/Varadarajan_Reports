Puhnonary Function Evaluation In MIC Exposed Population Suffering FrOID
Bronchial Obstruction
The mean observed and reference pulmonary function values and their differences in the
male population with airway obstruction are shown in Table 26. It can be observed from the
table that the mean observed lung function values were significantly decreased in comparison to
their respective mean reference values in the M IC exposed male population. Thus VC revealed a
significant mean difference of -0.27±0.07 litres between the mean observed and the mean predicted
values in the male population (p<0.005). Similarly FEVo' 75 and FEV1 also exhibited significant
mean decreases of -0.38 ±0.13 litres and -O.33±0.13 litres respectively as compared
to their respective mean reference values (p<0.05).
The FEV1 /FVC ratio expressed in
percentage revealed a mean observed value of 64.0±1.2% thereby indicating that these
bronchial obstruction cases suffered from mild category of obstructive ventilatory syndrome induced
by M IC exposure in the male population. The prevalence of bronchial obstruction was further confirmed by the impaired IMBC observed in such cases. IMBC showed a mean difference of -14.0±
5.6 litres/min between the mean observed and the mean reference values. The AVI index was also
found to be below normal indicating a mean value of 0.92~~ suggesting prevalence of airway
obstruction in the lungs of MIC exposed male population. However, two pulmonary tests viz., FVC
and PEFR, although revealing decreased observed mean values in contrast to reference values, did
not differ statistically. This is normally expected in the mild obstructive cases since PEFR has wide
variability and has the inability to pick up mild bronchial obstruction within the lungs. FVC is g~ne­
rally normal or near normal in such cases. Thus we find that a battery af pulmonary function tests
conducted in the MIC exposed male population viz., FEVo' 75 ' FEV1 •O' lowered FEV l IFVC ratio
«70%), the lowered AVI% (1) and IMBC revealed the presence of obstructive dysfunctioning in
such cases.
