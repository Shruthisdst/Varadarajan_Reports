Differential Leucocyte Count
All the cases studied were divided in to two groups, i.e. those having polymorphs less than
70% and those with more than 70%. Increased polymorpho:1uclear leucocytosis was found in 71
subjects (11.9%) of the overall population. Similarly, the cases ware divided in two groups having
less than or more than 40% lymphocytes. The number' of subjects showing lymphocytosis more
than 40 010 was found to b3 188 (31.6%). Eosinophils ware found to be more than 6% in 171
subjects (28.7%,) (Table 6).
The percentage of cases showing increased polymorphonuclear leucocytosis was almost
similar in different age groups, i.e. 16.1, 11.1, 11.4, 14.4 and 12.0 per cent in age groups up to 15,
16-25, 26-35, 36-45 and more than 56 years respectively, except in age group 46-55 years where
only 7.10/0 subjects showed polymorphonuclear leucocytosis (~ore than 70%).
