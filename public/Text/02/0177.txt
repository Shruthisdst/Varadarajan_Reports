Reagents

Ninhydrin reagent: Prepare a 0.2 % (w/w) solution of ninhydrin in isopropanol (0.16 gm dissolved in 100 ml isopropanol). This reagent is
stable for 2 weeks if kept in a brown bottle.
Absorbing solution: Dilute one volume of conca
Hel to 100 volumes with isopropanol.
Reagent Grade Pyridine
n-Butylamine stock solution: (500 pg/ml).
Weigh 0.250 gm of n-butylamine in a weighing
bottle and dilute to 500 ml with absorbing solution.
n-Butylamine calibrating solution: Prepare a
series of standards containing 2 to 100 p.g/ml nbutylamine by diluting 0.4 to 20 ml of n-butylamine stock solution to 100 ml with absorbing
solution. Take 1 ml of each solution and follow
the analytical procedure.
