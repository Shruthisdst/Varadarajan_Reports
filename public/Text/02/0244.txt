RADIOLOGICAL STU-DIES
Since exposure to methyl isocyanate resulted in very severe pulmonary involvement such
as pulmonary oedema and chemical pneumonitis, examination of respiratory system of the surviving
population was required.
For this purpose apart from the clinical examination, haematology,
pulmonary function studies etc. radiological examination of the exposed population was also
conducted. A full sized (12" x15") chest X-ray posteroanterior view was taken in all the cases
using a portable X-ray plant, and was read-by a panel of three experts of the following disciplines:
a radiologist, a chest diseases specialist and an industrial medicine specialist and salient features
of MIC exposed lungs pointed out.
The radiological findings are given in the following table:

---739 subjects (81.8(10) out of a total of 903 subjects studied radiologically showed no
abnormality in their X-ray. X-ray picture of 91 subjects (10.10;0) showed radiological changes
suggestive of definite pathology like pulmonary tuberculosis, pneumonitis, chronic bronchitis,
emphysema etc. Specific radiological changes were observed in 73 subjects (8.1 (Yo). These subjects
have been classified as below:
