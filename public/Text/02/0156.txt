PHYSICO-CHEMICAL & TOXICOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF MIC

4.1 Physical Properties

0.9599 at 20/20o C
39.1 o C
below 7°C

MIC is sparingly soluble in water, it is coloUIless and extremely flammable.

4.2 Chemical Properties
(a) On prolonged standing MIC is reported
to get converted to dimeric and trim eric
isocyanic esters.
(b) MIC is hydrolysed rapidly by water giving alkyl amine and disubstituted urea.

The reactions are instantaneous. In view
of the great reactivity of MIC, it is likely
that the above chemical transformation
will be most marked in the environment
Le. air, water and soil. Exposure to moisture leads to formation of CO 2 and the
development of pressure in closed containers resulting in rupture of metal and
glass containers.

4.3 Toxic Effects
Vapours of MIC irritates the respiratory system
and/or severely causes lachrymation. The liquid
irritates the eyes, skin and respiratory system.
On inhalation it causes pulmonary oedema.
