potentiometrically. Residue samples from tank

by this procedure. All the samples after diluting
Procedure:
with water were made acidic with dilute nitric
Standard mixture containing MMA, DMA and acid before titration.
TMA were prepared from the corresponding
standard solution of amines. Standard solutions Reagents and Apparatus:
(0.5 J,Ll) were injected into the Gas Chromatograph. The ID Table was prepared and filed. Analar Grade reagents were used for all the work
The reliability of the method was checked by
