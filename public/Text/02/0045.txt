CH 3 NHCH 3 + HNCO + CH NCO

DMA

This reaction is analogous to the fragementation
of DMAC shown in Eq. 5 and can satisfactorily account for the quantities of DMI formed.
As an experimental support for the reaction
depicted in Eq. 6, pure TMB, on heating to
250 0 C for 45 min. (Expt. No. 29), gave about
4% DMI in addition to the major products,

DMU and MICT.
Even though Eq. 6 depicts a mode of thermal decomposition of TMB to give HNCO, the
major thermal fragmentation route of TMB
would be into its congeners DMU and MIC,
shown in Eq. 7, This is the reverse of formation of TMB from MIC and DMU and is an
equilibrium reaction:

MIC

The equilibrium would shift to the right if
MIC were to be removed by an irreversible
trimeri~ 'jon reaction. This accounts for the

heat ;)

A further possible mode of thermal fragIllentation of TMB is shown in Eq. 8. This also
is an equilibrium reaction and shows the possibility of formation of MMA, All the above

major products, DMU and MICT, mentioned
Ibove in Expt. No. 29.

(8)

three modes of fragementation of TMB shown
in (6), (7) and (8) are thermally allowed electrocyclic processes proceeding through energetically favourable six-membered transition states.
