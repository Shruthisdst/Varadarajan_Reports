The different types of restrictive ventilatory impairment observed in the study population
are shown Table 5. 97 (12.3%> cases revealed the prevalence of mild restrictive pattern of the
lung disease in the study population. Spirometric results further indicated that its prevalence was
significantly higher in the male population (14.8%) in comparison to (10.1 %) observed in the
female population (p<0.05). This shows that the restrictive lung disease induced by the methyl
isocyanate gas, affected male population more.

The overall prevalence of moderate ventilatory restriction was found to be 0.3% in the
study population. Sex-wise, it was seen that among the male population there was none with this
category of the disease while only 3 (0.7%) reported moderate restriction in the lungs in the female
population. Similarly, the severe form of the restrictive impairment was only observed in 5 (1.2,},o)
female cases. No case of severe restriction was reported in the male population. The overall
prevalence of severe pulmonary restrictive impairment was observed in 0.6% cases out of 783 cases
studied. Thus it can be concluded from Table 5 that the observed restrictive abnormality was
chiefly mild in nature induced by methyl isocyanate gas exposure.

Table 6 describes the prevalence of various forms of combined restrictive cum obstructive ventilatory impairment in the MIC exposed population. The mild restrictive~cum-obstructive
pulmonary abnormality was observed in 117 (14.9%) cases in the MIC affected population.
Sex-wise, it was seen that the female population was significantly more affected (18.2%) than the
male population (11.3~~) (p<O.01).

Among the male population the effect of smoking was clearly demonstrated as smokers
revealed significantly higher prevalence of mild mixed lung abnormality (13.5%) (p<0.005).
