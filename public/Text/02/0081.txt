APPENDIX II
Energy Balance Calculations
The total heat liberated can be calculated as

LHn

Q=
where

Rn = Amount (gmoles) of reactant n consumed/total amount reacted
A Hn = Heat liberated/gmole

Q=

5466.497 x 10 3 kcal

IDitial quantity of MIC = 40909 kg.
Residue = 15200 kg.
This implies that amount of MIC escaped = 29012 kg.
Therefore we calculate heat liberated = Sensible heating + evaporation + heating of residue
giving 5466.497 x 10 3 = 40909 x 0.5 x (Tp - 20) + 25709 x 123.88 + 15200 x 0.5 (T - Tp)
leading to the conclusion that final temperature T = 1490 C
Similarly the final temperature can be calculated for various vaporization temperatures.
