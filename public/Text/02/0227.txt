The lowest prevalence (2.6%) of obstructive ventilatory syndrome was recorded in the
46-55 year age group while the highest prevalence (4.7%) was reported in the 26-35 year age
group which was statistically insignificant. The obstructive pulmonary impairment. did not reveal
any systematic .trend with advancing age.
The restrictive pattern of ventilatory defect ranged from 7.0% to 21.4% in the 16-25 year
and 56-64 year age groups respectively, the difference being significant at p<0.1 level. Here also
no significant correlation could be established between the prevalence of restrictive impairment and
the advancing age.
In case of mixed ventilatory impairment, its lowest prevalence (11.2%) was observed in the
16-25 year age group while the maximal prevalence (64.2%) was recorded in the 56-64 year age
group which was significantly higher in the latter group (p<0.005). Like obstructive and restrictive
ventilatory defects, it also failed to observe any definite correlation with increasing age.
Age-wise prevalence of various for:ms of obstructive bronchial impairment in the female
population exposed to MIC gas is presented in Table 12. Mild airway obstruction was maximally
recorded (7.6%) in the 36-45 year age range while the age group 46-55 year revealed its minimum
prevalence (2.6%) which was found to be insignificantly different from the high:st incidence. We
did not observe any cas~ of mild bronchial obstruction in the age group of 56-64 years. No significant association could be established between its prevalence and the increasing age. Moderate
obstructive syndrome ranged from 0.7% to 1.4% showing its highest prevalence in the youngest age
group i. e. 16-25 years. No case of moderate obstruction could be detected in the 36-45 year,
46-55 year and the 56-64 year age groups. Severe ventilatory obstruction was recorded (1 .0%)
only in 36-45 year age group.
The prevalence of restrictive ventilatory defect in various age groups in female population
is shown in Table 13. The maximal prevalence (14.1 (%) of mild restriction was observed in the
36-45 year age group while females in the age group of 16-25 year were minimally affected by this
disorder. Moderate cases of restriction were observed only in 26-35 year (1.5%) and 46-.95 year

maximally (7.1%) whereas only 0.7% cases were affected in the 26-35 year age group. No case of
severe restrictive pulmonary impairment was recorded in the 16-25 year age group. None of the
types of restrictive disorders showed any systematic trend with advancing age.
The distribution of the prevalence of combined restrictive-cum-obstructiva lung disorder in
different age groups in female cases is presented in Table 14. Female cases in the age group of
46-55 year revealed the highest prevalence (31.5%) of mild combined ventilatory impairment in
contrast to the minimum prevalence (9.8%> observed in the 16-25 year age group. However, mild
mixed lung abnormality did not observe any definite pattern with the advancing age. The moderate
degree of the combined impairment ranged from 1.4% in the 16-25 year to 35.7% in the 5?-64 year
age groups. Moderate type of the combined lung disorder revealed a significant correlation with
the increasing age, The analysis of the results indicated a positive correlation between its incidence
and the age. This shows that as the age increased the prevalence of combined pulmonary disorder
also increased. Severe mixed spirometric defect ranged from 2.1 % in the 36-45 year to 14.2%
in the 56-64 year age groups. No case of severe restrictive-cum-obstructive impairment was repor
ted in the 16-25 year age group. Unlike moderate mixed lung abnormality, it did not show any
p

direct correlation with age.
