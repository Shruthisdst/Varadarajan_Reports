A magnetic stirrer was used for stirring the
solutions during titrations. End point of the
titrations were determined by plotting m V
against volume of standard Ag NO 3 added. The
end point potential was set at + 300 m V .
Experimental:

General Procedure :

About 0.5 to 1 gm of a sample was accurately
weighed using a Sartorius Balance. The weighed
sample was transferred into a 250 ml beaker and
diluted to about 80 ml with distilled water.
The solution was made acidic by adding 5 ml
of 1 :3 dilute nitric acid. The chloride ion
selective electrode and the reference electrode
(D jJ reference electrode with sodium nitrate
in the outer compartment) were introduced

into the solution and kept on the magnetiC
stirrer. A teflon coated magnetic needle was
used as the stirring bar. The electrodes were
connected to the automatic titrator. The end
point of the titrator was set at + 300 m V.
Before starting the titration, the solution was
stirred well to ensure tt.lat all the chlorides are
dissolved in the solution. The stirring was
continued throughout the titration. The burette addition automatically stopped when the
potential reached + 300 m V. The volume of
silver nitrate solution added was noted down
after titration was over.
The chloride content in the samples were
calculated from the equation
1 ml of O.IN Ag NOS = 3.55 mg cr
