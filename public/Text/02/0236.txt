litres) in the symptomatic female population which was significantly affected in contrast to the mean
difference of-3.B Iitres noticed in the symptomless female population. Similar significant reductions
in the absolute observed values of FEV o' 75 ' FEV1 and PEFR were recorded in the symptomatic
female population suffering from various respiratory symptoms. Thus the FEVo' 75 revealed a mean
value of 1.75 litres in the affected population which was significantly reduced in comparison to the
mean value of 1.97 litres observed in the unaffected female population (p<O.Ol). The FEV1 showed
a mean value of 1.90 litres in the symptomatic population which was significantly decreased in
contrast to the mean observed value of 2.12 litres recorded in the asymptomatic female population
(p<0.05). Similarly PEFR revealed a significant difference between the two groups (p<0.05).
However, FVC, FEV1/FVC percentage and Air Velocity Index (AVI) were not significantly reduced in
the symptomatic female population.

Pulmonary Function Assessment In MIC Exposed Population Affected By
Respiratory Impairment

Anthropometric Details: The physical characteristics of the male and female population
affected by obstructive, restrictive and the mixed ventilatory impairment are shown in Table 25.
Among the male population studied, the bronchial obstruction cases were the oldest and the cases
with lung restriction were the youngest. The other anthropometric details viz., height and weight
were identical in the male population suffering from obstructive, restrictive and combined ventilatory
defects, while in the female population the mixed pulmonary impairment cases were the oldest
and the obstructive cases were the youngest. The female population with restrictive lung disorders
were found to be tallest in comparison to others who suffered from obstruction and combined pulmonary defect. However, weight-wise there was no significant difference observed among the categories of pulmonary impairment cases.
