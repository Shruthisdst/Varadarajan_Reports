IMMUNOLOGICAL

STUDIES

Immunological tests are among the most sensitive indicators in predicting or detecting
the t.oxicity caused by chemicals. Therefore, immunological studies were conducted in methyl
isocyanate (M IC) exposed· victims of Bhopal, to ascertain whether or not, M IC h3s altered the
natural defence or immune system of the host.

Immunoglobulin Estimation
The quantification of immunoglobulins was performed by Radial Immuno Diffusion (RID)
technique, using tripartigen plates supplied by Hoechst Pharmaceuticals Ltd India.

Immunoglobulin G (lgG) is the most common and predominant immunoglobulin present in serum.
It enhances phagocytosis and helps in neutralization of toxins. IgG was studied in 389 MIC exposed
cases and the mean value was found to be 1242 ± 12.28 mg% out of which 4% of the cases
showed higher IgG values; mean 2847.46 ± 0.99 mg(Yo with a range of 2334 mg% to 3474 mg%.
In 7%. of the cases the IgG levels were below the normal value (Tabla 1 A and Table 3) with a
r&::nge of 300mg%) to 620mg%. Immunoglobulin A (lgA) was estimated in 312 MIC exposed cases.
The mean value was found to be 213.95 ± 4.40 O1g%. Among these, 7% of the cases were of low
IgA values i.e. 70.83 ± 5.82 mg% with a range of 20.00 to 118.90 mg% (Table 1 B and Table 3).
In 309 MIC exposed victims, the value of Immunoglobulin M (lgM) was found to be
177.00 ± 5.00 mg%. In 8% cases, IgM was raised (390.95
10.43 mg%).with a range of 294.74
to 436.79 mg%. Lower values were observed only in 2% of the cases with a mean value of
39.24 ± 0.10 mg% (Table 1 C and Table 3).

±

C~reactive

protein (CRP)

CRP was estimated in 168 cases.

It was not found elevated in any of the cases.

Rheumatoid factor (RF)
It was estimated in 168 cases out of which only two cases showed raised levels.

Anti-Streptolysin 0 (ASO)
Among 168 gas exposed cases, none of them showed high levels of ASL in sera.
CRP, rheumatoid factor and ASO were determined by Slide Agglutination method.

Cell-viability
Cell viabi lity was determined by Trypan Blue Exclusion method.
victims was found to be normal (mean 94.36 ± 0.46%).
