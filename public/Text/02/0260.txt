Examination of the Urine in MIC Patients
Among the' surveyed population of the MIC exposed area, both females and males have
been found to have a relatively high value of creatinine in their urine samples compared to the
control subjects (Table5). It ranges from 2.20 to 5.04 gm/24 hrs in males and 1.,99 to 3.89 gm/24
hrs in females with an average value of 3.30 gm/24 hrs and 2.95 gmJ24 hrs respectively. Apparently,
no change was observed in GPT activity of MIC exposed patients after 4 months. Release of
creatinine in the urine sample of MIC exposed patients indicates an increased breakdown of
creatine phosphate as a result of muscular distress produced after MIC exposure (Oser, 1965).
