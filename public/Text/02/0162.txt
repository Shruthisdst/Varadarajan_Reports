9.0 CLIMATOLOGICAL STUDY &
WEATHER REPORT
NEERI coordinated with India Meteorological
Department (IMD) in the collection of meteorological data. This information was required
to arrange the neutralization/utilization of MIC
(during favourable weather conditions to pre164

vent any further exposure of MIC to the community in the area).
It was felt that the data from the regular
observatory at Bairagarh airport may not be
useful in the context of micro-meteorological
aspect of the demanding situation. Bhopal city
is hilly and basinlike. Three more observatories
in addition to the one already existing observatory of Il\1D were set up to ascertain the
weather features of the local areas. Besides,
temperature inversion data was collected with a
frequency of four radiosonde ascents in 24
hours, every day.
