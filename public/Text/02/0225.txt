mum prevalence (23.5";») was recorded in the 56-64 year age group.

In case of moderate mixed

ventilatory abnormality, the lowest incidence (0.8
was reported in the 26-35 year age group and
the highest (5.0%) was noticed in the 36-45 year age group. There wara no cases of moderate
mixed ventilatory defect observed in 16-25 and 56-64 year age groups, while severe combined
restrictive-cum-obstructive impairment cases were maximally (17.6%) recorded in the 56-64 year
age group. The mixed ventilatory syndrome either mild or moderate or severe fail3d to reveal any
significant association between its prevalence and the advancing age as there was no systematic
trend observ£d in this study.
