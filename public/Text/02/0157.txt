Priority pollutant

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of the
US4 in their code of Federal regulations (USEP A July 1983) classifies methyl isocyanate
(Hazardous Waste- No.P064) as an acute toxic
compound (Annexure 2). Methyl isocyanate,
mono and dimethyl anline and dimethyl urea do
not appear as priority pollutants in the US EPA
Tabulations for Priority Pollutant, as of April
1980. The compounds on the list (Annexure 3)
are for their presence in the wastewaters from
industries. Codes of safety prepared by Chemical
Hazards Sectional Committee of lSI (CDC: 18)
do not include information on MIC or methylamines. However IS: 8185-1976 refers to phosgene. Even in the proposed programme of CDC
18, lSI, MIC and alkylamines are not included.

analytical methods for the study of total isoc~ anates and amines in air samples. Following
methods were studied:

Isocyanate Concentration

October 1979, Vol. 101, p. 928-936.
(The above method recommends the use of
1,1,2-trichloroethane as the extracting solvent
for complex. As this reagent was not available
anywhere in India, experiments were done using
carbon tetrachloride as the alternate solvent)

Tentative method of Analysis for Primary
and Secondary Amines in the Atmosphere
(Ninhydrin Method)
Ref: 43724-01-73T - Standard Methods for
Air Analysis.
The details of the analytical methods, apparatus, reagents and procedure adopted are summarised in annexure 5. Ninhydrin Method was
adopted for environmental monitoring.
