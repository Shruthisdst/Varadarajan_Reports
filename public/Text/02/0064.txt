portion of chloroform than usual. The present
report assumes that the tank had about 8%
chloroform contamination. Based on the material balance considerations presented in the Part
I, we also assume that about 450 liues of water
entered the tank. These values have been used
for quantitative evaluation of the model.

In order that we can proceed with our model
building effort, we need kinetic rate data on
various reactions that occured. Unfortunately, as
mentioned earlier, no such data are readily available. As regards the main stoichiometric reaction
