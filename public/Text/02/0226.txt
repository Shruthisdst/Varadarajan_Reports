Age-wise Prevalence of Respiratory Impairment io FeIDale Population

The prevalence of obstructive, rt:strictive and the combined restrictive-cum-obstructive ventilatory impairment in different age groups in the female population is shown in Table 11. The
youngest age group i.e., 16-25 years reported the minimum prevalence (26.8%) of overall respiratory
impairment in contrast to the maximum prevalence (85.7%) observed in the 56-64 year age group
(p<O.005).
