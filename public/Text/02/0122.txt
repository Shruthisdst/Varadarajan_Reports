From Dr. G. Tbyagarajan
Possible causes of the
accident

G>mment

A- Ingress of a small amount
of water from impure
N 2 - led to destruction
of inhibitor phosgene,
liberating some chlorides,
which caused MIC polymerization.

Possibly, but reaction too slow to
have triggered the
sudden lift of (incubation time data
from lit). If this was
the reason. why 611
did not lift off?
Pressure data do not
favour this.

B- Some HClliberated
together with rust or
such Fe particles, generated a polymerisation,
release of heat, MIC
vapourisation etc.etc.

0

Formation of various
polymerisation products in the tank.

-

All these can be
explained.

0

Because of high temperature, if the MIC in
610 was off-spec.
material containing
large % of CHCI3. Then
decomposition of CHCl3
might have taken place
at high temperature
giving rise to hydrolysable chlorides.

-

CHCl3 can be decomposed at high
temperature, so
explainable.

Concurrent rapid polymerisation of MIC accelerated by Fe, FeC13, etc.

C- A surge of water entered
the tank, and the following occurred:
0

MIC-water reaction,
forming CHJNH2,
CO2, DMU and TMB
etc.

- Well known

0

Temperature indueed rapid polymerisation of MIC itself.

- Wen known

Vapourisation of
substantial quantity
of MIC and release
into the air.

-

610 MIC was sufficiently
off - spec. to have polymerised, aidt"cl :'y metallic
impurities in the tanks.

By consensus of:

0

Records show the
temper.ture shot
upto not less than
17 SoC. (trimer
sublimes at 1750 )

Excerpt from Operating Manual, p. 138,
Novo 1984

The instruments on MIC Transfer line from
MRS condenser liquid outlet and storage tank
inlet....... .
Temp. diff. between two temp. sensing
points is measured. MIC takes 12 to 15 mts. between the two temp. sensing points. Time is ade-

quate for reaction to occur and can be detected
in the event of contamination. The instruments
have a sensitivity to detect a l o C temp. This is
equivalent to less than a gallon of water per day
reacting in 1411lb/hr MIC stream.
