and methyl isocyanate (5.7 g) in DMF (100 ml)
was allowed to react for 24 hr at 75°C. The
DMF was removed by distillation over steam
bath to yield a sohd mass as residue. It was
stirred in water (50 ml) and filtered to remove
l,3,5-trimethyl isocyanurate (MICT). The filtrate was acidified with conc. HCl. The precipitated isocyanuric acid was filtered and was
recrystallized from little charcoal and hot
toluene to furnish pure colourless crystals of
I,3-dimethyl isocyanuric acid. Yield 2.2 g.m.p.
222-223 0 C. (lit. report 223°C).

1,3,5-Trimethyl biuret (TMB)

Ref: Heinrich Blitz, Chern. Ber 56B, 191426 (1923).
A mixture of sym N ,N-dimethyl urea (3g)
and methyl isocyanate (3 g) was heated in a
S-S-bomb at 100°C for 2 hrs. Afterwards the
unreacted methyl Isocynate was evaporated and
the residue was recrystallized from hot benzene.
Yield 1.5 g.m.p. 126°C. (lit. reported 126°C).

1,1,3-Trimethyl urea (TMU)

Ref: School and Holdmann, Ann. 345, 376
(1907)
To a solution of pet. ether (125 ml) and
dimethylamine (4.5 g) methyl isocyanate
(5.7 g) was added at 0-5 0 C in 0.5 hr. A colourless solid separated immediately. The reaction
mixture was stirred for 5 hrs. Afterwards excess
dimethylamine in pet. ether (10 ml 0.8 N)

was added to the reaction mixture and stirred
for 0.5 hr. The solution was found to be alkaline
The crystalline TMU was filtered,
(pH B).
washed with pet. ether, dried under vac. at room
temperature. Yield 9.5 g, m.p. 74°C (lit. reported 74-750 C).

5. 1,1,3,5-Trimethyl biuret (TRMB)
A mixture of 1,1,3-trimethyl urea (1.03 g)
and methyl isocyanate (1.6 g) was heated in a
S.S. reactor at 100°C for 3 hrs. The excess
unreacted methyl isocyanate was evaporated.
The residue left was analysed by G.C. and
G.C./m.s. and was found to be a mixture of
DMU, TMU, TRMB AND TMB. The mixture
contained about 40% of TRMB which could not
be separated and purified.

1,3,5-Trimethyl-~,3,5-triazine-2,4(lH,
diane (Dione)

3H)-

Ref: Etienne' alll.; Bonte, Bull. Soc. Chern. Fr.
1419 (1975).
To a solution of 1,3,5-trimethyl biuret
(2 g) in carbon tetrachloride (5 ml) methylal
(2.4 g) and conc. sulphuric acid (6 g) was added.
The reaction mixture was stirred at room
temperature for 24 hrs. Next day the solvent
was evaporated and the residue was diluted with
water (20 ml). The reaction mixture was extracted with chloroform (50 ml). The chloroform
layer was dired and distilled. The residue when
crystallized by benzene and pet. ether (60-BOoC)
gave colourless crystals. Yield 1.2 g.m.p. 93°C.
(lit. reported 95°C).
