Micro determination in Ai, using a short Chromatograllhic Column

Methyl isocyanate is collected by passing air through a stainless steel tube, 1 !~. -X 10",
packed with 5 per cent didecyl phthalate on C-22 firebrick. The tube is cooled with dry ice and
the sample is collected at 0.5 litre per minute for two hours. Methyl isocyanate is degassed from
the tube by heating into an evacuated flask c~ntaininH dimethyl sulfoxide hydrochloric acid (OMSOHel) absorber solution. Methyl isocyanate is then estimated as in the colorimetric method.
