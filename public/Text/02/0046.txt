Dimethylamine (DMA) and Trimethylamine (TMA)

An in terestmg feature of reaction (6) is
that it also offers an explanation for the formation of dilnethylamine (DMA) which has
been found in the tank residue in the form of
DMA hydrochloride, TMU (DMA + MIC) and
TRMB (TMV + MIC).
An explanation for the formation of DMA
and TMA has been advanced by VCC scientists
based on the known disproportionation of
MMA. Hel at high temperatures to ammonium
chloride and di, tri, and tetramethyl ammonium
chlorides. One difficulty with acceptance of this
hypothesis is that sizeable quantities of ammonium chlo'ride should also have been present in
the tank residue which does not appear to be the
case.

Formation of TMA can also be explained
through the thermal fragmentation of TRMB
shown in Eq. 9 below. This reaction would be
analogous to the fragmentation of TMB shown
in Eq. 6.
Both DMA and TMA can thus be formed by
the thermal cracking of TMB and TRMB res
pectively.

Tetramethylbiuret (TRMB)

A further mode of formation of HNCO
could be the thermal fragmentation of TRMB
shown in Eq. 9. This reaction also offers a
route for the formation of TMA which has
been found in significant amounts in the tank
residue.

Comments

The exploratory laboratory experiments
carried out so far provide sufficient information to enable a logical and plausible scenario
to be developed for the chemical reactions that
occurred in Tank 610.

A fmer focussing of the gross chemical piCe
ture would be possible only by conducting detailed simulation experiments with control and
measurement of reaction parameters like temperature and pressure and more detailed analyses inc'luding that of all gaseous products. These
