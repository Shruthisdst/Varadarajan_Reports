centration of 15.2 kg moles (540 kg). All the
amines taken together add up to 16.9 kg moles
in the residue (800 kg). In all, a total of 97 kg
moles of compounds are present in the residue,
accounting for about 12 tonnes out of the 12.5
tonnes of the residue estimated to be present.

Examination of the anlytical results reveals
that the residue mass contains products which
could be considered as derived from the MMAMIC reaction. MMA can also be produced by
the reaction of water and MIC. It can therefore be concluded that either water or MMA
entered the MIC storage tank E 610.

2.4 Reactions involved

Reaction sequences that take place when
either water or MMA enters the MIC tank are
depicted in Chart 1.

The percentages as well as the total quantities of
all components found in the tank residue are
presented in Table 2.9.
MIC, in the absence of external reagents but
in the presence of catalyst, can trimerize to
give 1,3,5 trimethyl isocyanurate (MICT).
The residue has been found to contain MICT
to the extent of 40 mole percent.

The chemical structures of the compounds
are shown in Fig 2.3.
From simple stoichiometric calculations
the total quantity of water required for all th~
reactions involving water can be calculated.
This amounts to about 450 kg.
