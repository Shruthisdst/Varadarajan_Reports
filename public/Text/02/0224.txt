The pattern of restrictive ventilatory abnormality was minimally (10.8 %) observed in the
26-35 year age group while the maximal prevalence was recorde.d in the 56-64 year age groups.
No significant correlation could be worked out between the age and tne restrictive. pattern of pulmonary abnormality in the male population.
The lowest prevalence (8.20/0) of mixed pulmonary impairment was recorded in the youngest
age group, 16-25 years and the highest (41.1 %) was seen ; n the 50,-64 year age group. The combined restrictive-cum-obstructive ventilatory impairment did not reveal any systematic correlation
with age in the male population exposed to methyl isocyanate gas.
The prevalence of mild and severe obstructive impairment in different age groups in the
male population is shown in Table 8. The mild bronchial obstruction was seen minim ally (2.2'Yo)
in the 46-55 year age group while its maximal occurrence (17.6%) was observed in the 56-64 year
age group which was significant at p<0.05 level. There was no case of moderate bronchial
airway obstruction in the male population studied.
Severe bronchial obstruction was reported
only in the 36-45 year age group which revealed 1.2% prevalence. However, the mild obstruction
did not reveal any significant correlation with advancing age.
The prevalence ot restrictive pulmonary impairment in various age groups in the male population is presented in Table 9. The minimum preva lence (10.8%) of mild restriction in the lungs
was observed in the age group of 26-35 years and the maximum prevalence (23.5 %) was reported
in the 56-64 year age group. This difference in the prevalence was found to be insignificant. The
restrictive pattern of ventilatory abnormality did not bear any correlation with age.
The age-wise prevalence of combined restrictive-cum-obstructive ventilatory insufficiency in
male population is shown in Table 10. Age group 16-25 year revealed the minimum overall prevalence (8.1 %) while 56-64 year age group revealed the highest prevalence (41,1 0/ 0 ) which was
found to be highly significant (p<O.001). Among the various types of mixed ventilatory defects, the
mild mixed defect showed minimum prevalence (7.20/0 ) in the youngest age group while the maxi-
