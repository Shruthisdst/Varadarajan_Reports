did not influence its prevalence in males.

The severe combined restrictive/obstructive ventilatory syndrome affected 9 (2.4 ~Io) cases
out of the 783 cases studied. Sex-wise, there did not appear any significant difference in its prevalence. Smoking also did not h9va any effect on the prevalence.
Like obstructive and restrictive pulmonary impairment the observed combined ventilatory
defect was also predominantly mild in nature as revealed by the spirographic tracing recorded in the
exposed population.

Age-wise PrevaleDce of Pulmonary Impairment ia Male Population
The study population was divided into 5 age groups viz., 16-25 yaars, 26-35 yaars, 36-45
years, 46-55 years and 55-64 years to assess the prevalence of ventilatory impairment in various
age groups and to establish a correlation between the age and the prevalence of respiratory
abnormality.
The prevalence of various types of respiratory impairment in different age groups in the
male population is shown in Table 7. The overall prevalenc9 of ventilatory impairm3nt was found
to range from 25.0% in the 26-35 year age group to 82.3% in the 56-64 year age group which
was highly significant (p<O.001). The overall prevalanca of ventilatory impairment failed to
demonstrate any positive correlation with age. The 46-55 year age group revealed the minimum
prevalence (2.2%) of obstructive syndrome and the m3ximum (17.6(f~) was revealad in the 56-64
year age group. We could not find any association between the prevalence of tracheo-bronchial
Obstruction with increasing age.
