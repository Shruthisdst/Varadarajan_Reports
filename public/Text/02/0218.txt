Bhattacharya & Banerjee (1966) regression equations. The FEF 200~1200ml
and MMEF 15'75 %
were calculated over the FVC curve by the methodology of Leuallen and Fowler (1955).
PEFR/MMEF was calculated according to Bhalla et al (1979).

The ventilatory disturbance was classified as follows :
1.

Restrictive

Based on VC FVC (less than 80% of predicted)

2.

Obstructive

Based on lowered FEV1/FVC ratio Â«70%)

3.

Mixed

Mixture of restrictive & obstructive defect

t

80% of the predicted value was chosen as a reasonable level for all lung indices studied.
If the lung function values
The normal values ranged between 80-100% of the predicted ones.
were less than 80% of the predicted they were classified as abnormal and the severity of impairment was graded as follows :

1.

Mild impairment

Between 60-80%

2.

Moderate impairment

Between 40-60<yo

3.

Severe impairment

More than

STATISTICAL PROCEDURE
Chi square test was used for the determination of the significance of the prevalence of
various categories of respiratory impairme,t in the male and female M IC gas exposed population
classified into different age and distance groups.

The pulmonary function assessment was done by applying students paired/unpaired 't' test
in the methyl isocyanate gas exposed male and female population in different age and distance
groups.
