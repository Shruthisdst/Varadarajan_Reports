However, since the speculation and controversy
started hotting up, it became necessary to carry
out a few laboratory experiments to check this
point. Also, scientists at another laboratory in
India (designated Lab X) announced that they
had obtained appreciable amounts of cyanide
from thermolysis of MIC even at 3000 C.
Pyrolysis of MIC and analysis of cyanide

4.1

The following 3 samples of MIC were subjected to pyrolysis and the products analysed
for cyanide ion.

Pyrolysis of MIC at 300 0 C

The pyrolysis at 300 0 C of the following MIC
samples was studied:
