The female population which suffered from obstructive ventilatory impairment ravealed a
mean difference of -0.22±0.1 litres between the observed and the reference values of VC. This
was found to be decreased significantly at (p<0.05) level. The FEVt/FVC ratio revealed a mean
observed value of 63.2±2.2<yo which was found to be significantly decreased in comparison to the
normal value «70%) observed in the healthy population. The FEV1/FVC ratio suggeste~ occurrence of mild bronchial obstruction in the lungs which is also confirmed by the lowered observed
AVI index (0.81 ±0.04%) (normal = 1) in the female population studied .. Another confirmative test
of bronchial obstruction is IMBC which also revealed significantly decreased mean observed value
of 61.9±4.3 litres/min. This was found to be 20.5±4.2 litres less than the reference value calculated. Thus IMBC test was also significantly affected in the female population suffering from obstructive pulmonary syndrome (p<0.05).

The mean values of various pulmonary functions recorded in the male and female population suff€ring from restrictive lung abnormality are illustrated in Table 27. It is seen from the
table that the mean observed values of different lung parameters are significantly decreased in comparison to their mean reference values in the male and female .population. Among the male population suffering from lung restriction, VC exhibited a mean decrease of -0.92±0.03 litres and
FVC revealed a mean decrease of -0.55±0.05 litres in contrast to the respective mean reference
values of VC and FVC calculated in these cases. Thus it is observed that the VC and FVC were significantly reduced in these cases (p<0.001). ,Similar patterns were also marked with respect to
FEV"7!i and FEV1.O parameters. FEVo' 15 revealed a mean difference of - 0.23 ±0.03 and FEV!.o
showed -0.22±0.03 difference between the observed and the predicted values. Thus FEVo 'l5
and FEV1 •O parameters were statistically decreased at p<0.001 level. The FEV! /FVC percentage ratio
revealed a normal value of 84.0±1.06% in the male population affected by restrictive lung imp~ir­
ment. The Air Velocity Index showed a raised mean observed value of 1.30±0.02% thereby suggesting the presence of airway restriction in such cases. Besides this. IMBC and PEFR were also
significantly reduced in contrast to their respective mean predicted values (p<0.001).
In the female population suffering from restrictive lung disease, the mean observed
VC was found to be significantly less than the predicted value by 0.76±0.04 litres (p<0.001).
FVC revealed a mean difference of -0.38± 0.05 litres between the observed and the calculated predicted value (p<O.001). The ratio FEV1/FVC was found to be within the normal range.
Air Velocity-Index was characteristically found to be raised (1.21 ± 0.03%) thereby confirming the
presence of restrictive pattern of lung disease in the female population studied.

Mean lung function values and their differences between the observed and the predicted
values recorded in the male and female population are shown in Table 28. Among the male population, the mean observed values of VC and FVC were found to be significantly decreased in contrast
to the respective mean calculated reference values. The VC revealed a mean difference of 1.20 ±
0.06 litres and the FVC showed a mean difference of -1.19±0.22 litres between their observed and
the predicted values respectively. These diffe'rences in VC and FVC were found to be statistically
significant (p< 0.001). Similar trends were also recorded with respect to FEVu' j & and FEV\.o parameters. The FEVo' 7ii and FEV 1 •O showed significant differences of -0.91 ±0.06 litres and -0.84
