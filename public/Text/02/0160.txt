6.4 Preparation of Water Samples for the
Determination of Methylamines

tion as described under analytical'procedure. A
blank containing hydrochloric acid - isopropanol
and standards containing various amounts of
methyl amines in acid - isopropanol solution
were similarly run. Absorbance of blue colour
developed was recorded at 575 nm. Results were
computed after subtracting the absorbance of
the blank from the samples.

A 250 ml of water sample was transferred to a
500 ml separatory funnel. 5 ml of 4 N.NaOH
V{as added to it and content was shaken for
one minute. It was allowed to remain as such for
5 minutes. A 25 m} aliquot of carbon tetrachloride was added and the content was shaken for
2 minutes. The layers were allowed to separate.
The organic layer was saved. Carbon tetrachloride extraction was repeated on the aqueous
portion in the same way. The two carbon
tetrachloride extracts were taken in a separatory
funnel to which a 5 ml portion of 4 N hydrochloric acid was added. The contents were
shaken vigorously for 2 minutes. The layers
were allowed to separate. Organic layer was
discarded and acidic aqueous portion was preserved for the determination of methylamine.

The water samples collected on the two occasions have been analysed for the presence of
methyl isocyanate as methylamine. Results of
the analysis showed that methylamine was not
present at detectable concentrations in any of
the samples. Water samples were also analysed
for their physico-chemical characteristics. The
results of this analysis have been given in
Annexure 6.

The 5 ml acid extract was mixed well with 5 ml Monitoring schedule
Air monitoring for
of isopropanol. A 3 ml portion of this mixture methyl isocyanate was carried out on two occawas taken and subjected to the Ninhydrin reac- sions. The first was between 5th and 7th De-
