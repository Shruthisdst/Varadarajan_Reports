HAEMATOLOGICAL

STUDIES

Standard haematological tests were done on all the subjects using the routine clinical
methods in haematology and the results are summarized below.

Estimation of Haemoglobin
The majority of the population (67.1 %) had haemoglobin values higher than 12 gm%
while one-third of population (32.5%) had values between 8 to 12 gm % The percentage of
population having haemoglobin level less than 8 gm 0;0 was 0.4.
When haemoglobin count was correlated whith different age groups, no significant pattern
could be observed. The percentage of population having haemoglobin more than 12 gm% ranged
from 61.9 in the 26-35 years age group to 75.3 in the 16-25 years age group (Table 1).
There was also a direct relationship between haemoglobin level in the individual's residing
at different distances from the Union Carbide Factory.
Out of the total popul ation residing within 2 km from the factory, 65.5 per cent revealed
a haemoglobin level of over 12 gm<yo and a similar trend was observed in 80% of the population
living beyond 4 km (Table 2).

Red Blood Cell Count
The red blood cell count wc:s more than 4 million/cmm in majority of the population
(77.8%). Age-wise distribution pattern was 87.1,82.9,77.1,74.3,70.1 and 72.0 per cent respectively in subjects in age groups less than 15, 16-25,26-35,36-45 and more than 56 years (Table 3).
TotalÂ·ABC count of less than 3 million/cmm was observed in a very small percentage of
population. The percentage of population in different age groups which had ABC count between
3 to 4 million per cmm was between 12.9 to 28.0 per cent. No significant effect of the distance
from UCIL factory was noted on the red blood cell count.

Total Lel,lcocyte Count
The total leucocyte count (TLC) was high (more th3n 10,000) in 11.6 per cent of overall
population. It was almost similar in males and females being 10.3 and 12.6 per cent respectively.
The percentage of population having total leucocyte count less than 5000 was 6.4. The total leucocyte count (less ihan 5,000) was more in females (8.2%) than males (4.6 010). The total leucocyte
count (more than 10,000) has similar distribution in each population group residing between 2 km,
2-4 km, 4-6 km and more than 6 km from the factory (Table 4). Leucocytosis was maximum (28.00/0)
in age group ovtr 56 years. The percentages in the age groups less than 15, 16-25, 26-35, 36-45
and 46-55 were 6.4, 8.2, 16.6, 8.6 and 8.8 respectively (Table 5).
