Attention/Response Speed-This was studied by using the Reaction Time Test. It was
found that with light stimulus the exposed male group was significantly different with the control
at 5 per cent level and in the same group with sound stimulus the difference was significant only at
one per cent level, Exposed female group was significantly inferior to the control for both the stimuli.
It was also found that the overall exposed group was significantly inferior to control group. More
over, exposed males and females did not show any significant difference (Table 3a and 4b). Expo"Â·
sure to MIC equally affected the reaction time (attention/response speed) for both the stimuli in
both males and females. The results of Reaction Time Test showed that exposure to MIC
increased the attention/response speed of the affected persons.
Manual Dexterity-The effect of exposure on manual dexterity in comparison groups,
namely, control, exposed male and female were insignificant as 'F' value was found to be less than
one. It was concluded that exposure to M IC did not affect manual dexterity in the exposed
population.

When males and females were separately compared the results indicated that generally females
are more affected than males, however,no statistical evidence was established (p >0.05).
