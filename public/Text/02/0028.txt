Annexure 2.1

Gas liquid chromatography

The first compounds of the tank residue listed
under 2.3 were estimated by gas liquid chromatography . Various columns were investigated
for separation and quantitative estimation. The
following three columns were found suitable
for the separation of all these compounds and
quantitative estimation.

Temperatures
Column oven -180°C
Injection Port - 2500 C
Detector - 2500 C
Injection volume 0.4 1

1. FFAP - 3 - 10~

To analysis time - 43 min.

2. 'OV-210 + OV-17 - 3-5%

Method employed for quantitative analysis-

3. C'wax 20 M TPA - 5-7%

Absolute calibration curve method 44.

Variation in the load of the phase helps
in eluting all the components in shorter time.
Experimental results are givien in the following
section Standard solutions

The standard solution of each compound was
prepared by using purified compounds, with a
concentration to match the quantity of that
compound actually present in the samples. All
the standard compounds (synthesised or isolated) were characterised by their spectral data.
Acetone was used as a solvent for preparing the
solutions. Standard solutions of various concentrations of each compound were prepared to
match the peaks of the sample matrix.
