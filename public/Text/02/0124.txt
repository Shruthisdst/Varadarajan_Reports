NEGLIGENCE

1. Relief valve vent header and process vent
header should not have been interconnected.
This interconnection increased the possibility of water entering MIC tanks. It is well
known that MIC reacts violently with water.
2. Relief valve vent header should not have
been flooded with water.
3. The 6" CI valve located on RVVH near
phosgene vaporiser should have been slip
blinded before admitting water through a
hose
this is required as per the maintenance manual. This is also essential to avoid
water entering the R VVH which is also
connected to MIC tanks 610, 611 and 619.

7. Detailed hazard management procedures are
neither available nor followed to cope with
sudden and large releases of MIC stored in
tank farm.
8. No effective steps for mitigating the impending disaster were taken although pressure in
tank 610 started rising 2-3 hours before MIC
release. At 2220 hrs pressure had gone 10
psig (normal pressure = 2 psig). MIC release
occurred after 0015 hr.
9. Civil authorities were not informed of the
impending disaster whereby preventing them
from taking necessary steps between 22 20
and 00 15 hours before MIC was actually
released.

chlorides indicating the off-spec. MIC must
have been charged into this without knowing
the consequences.
12. What was the time lag between release of
MIC and actual reporting to civil authorities?
6. Scrubber and flare should not have been
taken down for maintenance as long as huge
quantity of MIC was stored in tank farm.
