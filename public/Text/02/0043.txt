Chloroform present in MIC appears to be
the main source of high cr ion content in the
residue. However, mechanism of formation by
hydrolysis with water is most unlikely since
no water would be expected to remain in
excess MIC at temperatures at which chloroform is known to react with water.

and MIC trimer (MICT) along with a smill
quantity of DMU. The TMB was approximately
equivalent to the water taken. No OM! was
detected and only a trace of dione was seen.
At 200 0 C and above, the ~hermal fragmentation and other reactions of ..lI'MB begin to
occur and products found in Tank 610 can be
detected. T,hus, the above reaction when conducted at 20QoC (Expt. No. 18) and especially at 215 0 - 220 0 C (Expt. No.45), produces
TMU, DMI and Dione in addition to MICT and
TMB. As the reaction temperature is raised further to 250 0 C (Expt. Nos 33 and 36) the QU811tities of TMU, DMI and Dione increase and TMB
decreases.

Trimethylbiuret (TMB)

The TMB formed is quite stable thermally
up to temperatures close to 2200 C. Thus, the reaction of MIC + CHClg + H2 0 at 190°C for 40

The diane is readily formed by reaction of
