in concentration was the commonest complaint causing problems at work and at home. Forgetfulness
was also a major complaint. The general symptoms were at the worst during the first month after
exposure to the gas. Lack of energy and physical capacity to work was also a common complaint recorded. Thus an appreciable amount of behavioural and psychological changes was evident
in this subject group investigated by us.

The above data, particularly those showing various abnormal physiological functions in the
population group studied by' us are indicati~e of various deleterious effects which appear to have
been caused due to exposure to the toxic gas released in the air by the Union Carbide
plant at Bhopal. All the people had complained about signs and symptoms which had quite
a great degree of similarity indicating that they were exposed to similar type of toxic gas.
Therefore, the signs and symptoms and after-effects recorded in the study appear to be related to
their exposure to methyl isocyanate gas and any others produced and released after the run-away
reaction in the storage tank of methyl isocyanate.
In order to study this toxic phenomenon in a controlled manner, we have been successful
in developing a laboratory animal exposure chamber to study the deleterious effects of MIC in rats
exposed to it through the inhalation route. Interestingly, many of the signs and symptoms involving
histopathological, immunological, behavioural, neurological and biochemical changes observed in
human patients, could be reproduced in animals exposed to MIC. This data would be compiled
in a separate volume later.
In order to further follow-up the conditions still existent in the population of Bhopal
exposed to MIC, this laboratory has recently carried out Phase-III studies in Bhopal in the month of
January, 1986. This data is being analysed for compilation in a separate volume.
