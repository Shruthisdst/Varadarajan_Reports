The table illustrates the sensi tivi ty of 6l!
to errors in
a and k. As expected. the response to errors in k is much more
predominant. A 20% positive error in k, for example, at 40 km
downwind will cause a four-fold error in
6~
Even a small
error of 10% ill k at 40 km will be reflected by a two-fold error
in b?::. At smaller distances from the stack the response to error
in a and k is smaller, but by no means negligible. If we considered
the errors to be negative, the value would be correspondingly reduced.

Plume rise

In ta~le 3 we h~~ presented the difference in plume rise ariBmg
out of the work of Briggs (1969) and ~orton et al(1956). The values
of Morton et al for no wind and stable conditions were greater by 8
factor of 2.5 than the values for a stable atmosphere with light wi~.

But, a8 we have seen earlier, the errors in concentration are
not measured by errors in 6~ ~ or hi but by errore in the ration o~/~
which is defined by ~ • As indicated by equation 3.5, we are
mainly concerned with variations in G(~).
