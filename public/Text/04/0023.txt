As per the work done in other coontries, the common pollutants .that affect the monumental con<;l",:u.·tion materials hke mNble, sand stone and pJastcf 'a:e

sulphur dioxide and particulate soot as primary pollutants to cause dama~ing effects. These are ~Iso
index of avera!,~ pollution carried by fo<;c;i) fuel !:ke
coal. oil elc. and other industrial activities. NO
is
·also a common pollutant of secondary importance as
it giv~ an index of high temperature combustion for
other photochemical activity.
Therefore, sulphur
dioxide., suc;pended particulate matter, NOx
