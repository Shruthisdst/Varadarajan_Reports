ABSTRACT

There Is proposal to establish a refinery near Mathura durmg
the late Fifth Plan or early Sixth Plan. Mathura is about 40 KM
from Agra, where one of the major to_urist attraction in India - The
raj Mahal is located. The designers of refinery are, a& a consequence, concerned about whether-the quantum of sulphur dioxide
released from the refinery stacks ~ould damage the Taj Mahal.

To meet t,his requirement, we' have computed the concentrati,()(1
of sulphur diOXide at different distances downstream from a r~finery
stack assltming' Gaussian distribution G'! the pollutant8. Delb~ wind
data have been used for the computations, the same have been dis-cussed here. In particular, we preseat quanti~alive estimate of
the impact of errors in vertical diffusion coefficients. the plume
rise and meteorological data. A compari80n ba8 been made of concentration values obtained with a limited number of Agra winds with the
estimates based on Delhi wind data. Computations have also been lot
the refinery in Uadras, so that the model could be tested against
field data in the vicinity of the Madras Refinery. We also show the
use of power~law to define vertical wind profile. It reduces the
concentration estimates without it by a factor of approximately t.
