BASIC EQUATIONS

The ~round level concelltr.ltions from an elevated source
are providecl by the Gaussian di~tribution. The short term
concentrations (1 hour) at tbe'··ground are,

In this expression we assume that there is no diffusion
downwind in the x direction.
Tbis is a reasonable assump~ion
f,..,~ large sampling pe.riods.
To obtain 3 aut! 24 hour concentrations, the 1 hour
values were multiplied by 0.84 and 0.59 respectively.
These
factors were obtained on empirical considerations. Turner
(1970) suggested an expression of the form.
