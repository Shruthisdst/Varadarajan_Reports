3.3 ,Possible sources 0/ Pollution at Agra

l

3.3.1 From NEERl's studies it has been established that there jc; substantial amount of pollution
both sulphur dioxides nnd particulate matter in the
Agra region particular Iy ncar the Agra Fort and tht
[raj Mahal. '. he possible sources of this pollution
are:
Two Power Plant~ne ncar the Agra
Fo, t :wd the other Ht ltmat-Ud-Dauluh
hoth of nominal cap3city 10 MW each.
The power plant at Agru Fort bas been
in operation for the last 50 years and is
con~;dered to be of very old and uneconomic design.
Approxlmntely one
rake of coal (about J Joo lonnes) is being used by fhese power pl:''lts daily.

Ah~tem('''t Mea~llre.f

3.4.1 At the inc;tance

crude oil imported from the Middle J?ast contafuing
about 2.0 per cent sulphur and the emissions ' from
the refinery stacks would have amounted to approD.
mafely 5 tonnes per hour. . SubscquentlYJ with the
pro~pects of Bombay Hi~h Crude
being available.,
the .efinery is now being designed to process 3
M fP A of imported crude and 3 MTP A of Bombay
t.i.ig!:!_ .a"'mvay Hig.'l cruoe IS a 10W~EUlphur crude
with cl sutphu:- ~ontent of 0.05 per cent. . At the
instance of the Committee, IOC have taken measures
to minimise the emission of sulphur dioxide from the
refinery stacks. This is being achieved by using
low sulphur fuel oil and gas in the furnaces of the
refinery and by installing a plant for removal
and
recovery of sulphur from the fuel gases. With this it
win be possible to limit the sulphur dioxide emission
from the refinery to a maximum of one tonne per
hour. Low sulphur fuel oil \\-iII be available through
processin£ of Bombay Hi~h Crude at Mathura Refinery If for any reason low sulphur fuel oil is not
available at the refinery. such fuclC\ can be obtained
from cither Gujarat or Barauni Refinery where l<?W
sulohur fuels are readily available
'.
3 4.3 For beUer dispersal of the sulohur dioxide
emis~ion from the stacks. the stack design has been
changed from the generally self-supporting stacks of
40 meters height to separate concrete staek~ of 80
meters height minimum. Instruments will be provided to continuouslv monitor emission of sulphur
dioxide from the variou~ stackc;. Calculations on the
