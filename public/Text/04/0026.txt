5.5 5mpentied ParliClIillte Matter III the Air at Agra
24 hour samples for the suspended
particulate
matter record the particulate levels in the air ranging
{rom 450 micrograms / ml in November and December whereas 250 micrograms/M3 In January
and
February (Figure 4) all the monitonng sites have
recorded similar trend of particulate" with a little
vanallon depending on the local activities.
Particutate matter at all the monitonng stations
excent Sikendra are identical. Red Fort site heing
slightly higher than other because of neighbourhood
activities of the power c;tation and tran"port.
Sikendrn site which is identified as control station
in relation to ~ulphur dioxide Icvels also holds good
in this respect. fhe exceptionally high valuo during
the month of February (at Si.1r.,endra) was due to
dust storm on one particular day of sampling. Normally the dvcr.tge v.tlue at Sikendra is about 150
micrograms/M I
fhe general pattern of 'iuspended
p&fticul&tc level IMS been illustrated In Figure 4.

\V tnds ,lfe recorded from

Building at the Clfcuit House compound. Expo~ure
of the wind in<;trument (',b'>crved to be ideal and
could be a reprc'>entativ ~ fur the raj Mahal and Red
Fort area.
Monthly wind ro"cs a,~ drawn for De2ember J<',5
and Janu~lfv-FebruafY 1976, (Figure 5).
Special
feature of the wind for the winter sca<;on (December
to February) seem'> to he with prevailing calm conditions. About 25 to 30 !ler cent time the winds are

calm. However, weak winds with a velocity rnngo
of 0 to 5 km/be was also recorded during December
and January. February winds seems to have been
little more active and the winds were rising occa~
sionally in the velocity range of 0 to 10 km/hr.

5.7 Directional Pattern of the Wind
Calm conditions prevail most of the time in
December and occasionally south-westerly
winds
were recorded.
rn January the magnitude of the
wind speed remain unch<lnged. However, the direction pattern was ob<;erved north-westerly as that of
January with little more active winds in the movemcnt. Thi~ explains the different levels of pollutants
at Red Fort1 Taj Mahal and Itmat-ud-Daulah during
December-January.

5.8 Temperature and Htmlldity
The temperature durinj! three months survey was
about with maximum 78Â°F and minImum 5S-F and
humidity about 40 per cent durin~ the day time and
~o to 90 per ce!1t in the night.

General Remarks
The data presented in this rel-::rt is a factual data
without conclusive interpretatiofl. More data c(.vering various aspects of meteorology. pollution etc. are
required (or conclusive interpretation in future. The
survey is being continued on those lines. However.
this will be discussed in the final report after completing the studies of the whole year.
