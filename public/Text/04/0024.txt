.t. Sampling Programme

24 hours period and normally the sampling geb
started by about J0.00 hours in the morrung a!Jt
continues till the next day up to 10.00 hrs. This COIlE
pletes the samphng of the day. On that basis effort
are being made to follow up the sampling frequenc
as descnbed in 2 as above.
"J he tcntative ~chcdule of sampling is shown if
the following table.

Air s.uuphng programme is designed as follow~. At
~J aJ Ivl.lhal the trequl.!ncy of sampling is on every al!ernaLe day and therefore each day of the week is
covered twice in a month. At other places seven

period c;tartin~ from middle of November t 975 till
the end of February 1976. This period ca 1 be classified as winter period and the observations made
can be attributed to the winter conditions at Agra.
Presence of sulphur dioxide and oartieulr te matter
are the main features of the obse;'vations made on
air quality survey. Other parameters, na.nelYt sulphation rate and NOx are found to be considerably
low during this survey period.' Thcse are discussed
