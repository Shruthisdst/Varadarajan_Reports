1976)

the order below to micrograms/m'! However, there
appeared a casual increase in the levels of sulphur
diOXIde {or a short interval The maximum level observed on 2 hourly sampling schedule ranged from
20 to 70 micrograms/m' at different monitoring
sites Such an observation was only once or twice in
a total period of -the calendar month. The month of
October (post-monsoon period), showed a rise in
the I;ulphur dioltidc level and the values recorded
ranged from 15 to 26 microgr.tms/m 1 (on the 24
hourly basi<;). Table-l show~ the statistics of the
complied observation~ from which it is clearly seen
that the rise in levels took place only in the month
of October while the rainy seac;on months recorded
vcr" low values.
5. As regards oxides of nitrogen levels, similar
pattern a~ obc:;crved in ca-.c of ~ulphur dioxide was
noted. Recdrded values arc in the range of 10-15

1. Air quality data on the project work for the
last summer months (March-May 1976) was lCported earlier in the Second Quarterly Report This
report consists of the monsoon and post-mon~oon
data for a period starting from June to October 1976
for 8 tot31 period of five months.
2... Air mmplillg
programme.-The
sampling
schedule wa~ continued to be of the same order wIthout nny change", in the onginnl programme. Sulphur
dioxide, oxide<i of nitl ogen~ suspended
particulate
matter IS being sampled on every fourth day at each
of the monitoring <;ite<;. Only monitoring site at Taj
Mahal being ~urveyed on every alternate days. Sulphation rate measurements are also carried out at
all the five location<;, namely, the Taj, Red Fort,
Itmat-ud-Daulah, Sikandara and Nagar Mahapalika.
Other two site<; have heen added for sulphation measurements one of which j<; at Fatchpur Sikrj,-Guest
House, and the other at Circuit Hou~e in Agra.
3. Wind data regarding speed and direction are
recorded at the Circuit House premises from the
Officers Hostel Building Roof.
4. Oh~erValiolls.-Table-l summarises the values
of pollutants observed during June to October 1976.
The monthly average is worked out on 24 hour basis
by computing 2 hourly values. Sulph_ur dioxide level
monsoon<;, (June to
was
very low during
Sept.
1976). The
recorded
value"
are
of

microgram~/m3,

6. Su~pended particulate levels were observed
lower than those recorded during summer. Summer
observations recorded the dust concentration level in
the range of 350 to 500 micrograms/m3 whereas
monsoon value~ were found in the order of 50 to
150 microgram~/m'. Only October values showed
sudden increa<;e in the order of 200 to 380 micrograms/ms (Tablt-l),
