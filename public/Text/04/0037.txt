shown as below:

During monsoon period the cnlm conditions wore ill
the range of 40 to 60 per cent and the prevailing
direction for the wind was southwest and west.

10. Remarks.-The general trend of the pollution
level for sulphur dioxide was found to be similar to
that recorded during the summer months. The levels
were considerably low (less than 10 micrograms/mS )
except during October when the values were little
higher. However. few individual two hourly samples which were observed at Red Fort and Itmat-udDaulah were little higher. The general trend of the
low levels of sulphur dioxide, sulphation rate and
suspended dust are due to rainy weather.
