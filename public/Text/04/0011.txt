in a scientific manner. Further, there is no exact or
.straight-forward method of conducting laboratory tests
to indicate or arrive at any realistic rate of deter~ora­
tion. with different levels of po!lutants. Thi" is primanly because the actual deterioration of monuments
could be and is due to diverse factors such as w3fer t
humidity, quality of stone, poJlutants in atmosphere
etc. and it is not possible to simulate in the laboratory,
the exact conditions to which tht" monument~ iilre subjected to. It was therefore nccessaty to know the present condition of the monuments bcfcrc the refinery
goes into operatIon and their condition after few years
of refinery's oper.llion to determine the extuu of dctcrionttioll, if any, :.lnt! ar1atysc the C'1U4ie for the samc.
ThIS would permit ..,doptlOn of further protective measures that need to be ('.Iken in ca~ of nccc<>sity. With
the approv.11 of the Comrmuce inniaHy ~uch a study
was entrusted to ., ecncao of haly.
3.6.2 In connection with the above studies entrusted
to Tecneco, their specialists visited the monuments
twice and coJiected samples from different pIaces from
various monum:nts. P,eces of old marble and stone
removed from the monuments during previous maintenance work were 411<;0 U'icd by Tccneco in this study.
Tccneco's team had collccted samples of marble and
sandstone from the original quarries at Mahrnna and
Jaipur. A summary of 'I ccneco's :cport i!:. g.ivcn in

It is necessary to remember that the annual increa.~e

the result of theOlcticai calculations
which, although carded out with
