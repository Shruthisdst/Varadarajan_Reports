CONC!..lfSIONS
Based on thc data IfWJ.:; avaihtble to the Committee as .well H'i the Jcsult'i of the studies and investigations undertalen, the foltowing conclusions ace
made.
4.1 There is Sub\t.!nltal level of pollution of sulphur dioxide nntl P irltculatc mnUe(' in the Agra
region. The pos~ihlc ~ources arc nil cool users con~
tisting of two Power Plant;;;. a number of small industries mainly foundnC's (approximately 250) and a
Railway Shunting Yard. As far as suspended particulate matters are cunccrn!!d, because of use of coal~
contributIon will he sub:;tantial. Even- though the
total amount
of emission of sulphur dioxide from
these sources rna}
be small,
on
account
of their proximity te the monuments, their contribution to the air quality of the zone will be consider-ably

high.
4.2 IOC have e~iimated tnat total emission of sulphur dioxide froot the refinery would be limited to,
one tonne per hOUf :tnd ihc~ eSlim~ltes have been
confirmed by the rep' c,('otative of the Ministry of
Petroleum. Since ha'\l\路"i'y low sulphur fucl will be
u~d in fhe iur n.t(,.. c~ :111<1 modern i04\trumcnts arc
avnil~lblc fOJ
proper mC:!Sl!ICl11cnt of cmi~si(}ns~ it
would he JlO"ibk h. f:tht'H, that the :lclUal emission
is limited to one !onnc per hour. loe h-:lve aho
assured that fl1<xkm tu:t~n()logy will be used for
electro-stalic precipitators of the power plant so that
particulate cmis~im: irom the slack is effectively
controlled.
4.3. IlH!'cd on the dispcr5:l1 studies made by IMD
and the investigations conducted by Tccncco and
NEER.! it has been .. ~timated that the contribution

from the refinery to the long term concentration of
sulphur dioxide at Agra would be of the order of one
to two micrograms per cubic metre compared to the
existmg level of IS to 20 micrograms per cubic
metre. Short term (one hour) peak COl1centration
(Jf tbe Ql"dcr of 65 microgran""ts per cubic metre could
be ex.pected und~r worst me(coro;ugkul condition.
in winter and the frequency for such occurrences arc
2.0-4.0 pei cent fOf Agra region路 and 0-1.0 per
cent [or Bharatpur region_
4.4 Adequate facilities arc being provided for
treatment of water eilluenh to meet the req .;ired
specifications laid down by (he Indian Sta.ndard
Institution. and the U.P. Government. Arrangement
will be made for
ensuring
proper
dilution of the tr-eated eflluents on occasions when enough
water is not available in the river for dilution. Ade路,
quatc expertise and pr-ovcn technology is a ..-ailable
indigenously for such ueatment plants. IOC are
operating similar planu in thdr existing re5.neries
satisfactorily.
4.5 So {~.r 'as the effect on the Uh:lratpur Bird
S;mctuary is concerned. it Ims been e!'itablish~d that
,here iii no likelihood of any ,Idvcp.c cUect either on
the bird~ or the pl.mt liie at Him! ~llpur on m;count
of the refinery.
4.6 Effective steps net-A to bl' taken qmddy to
reduce (he existing levci of pollution in Agc:!.
4.7 It will be necessary to ensure that the actual
-lung term contribution to the sulphur dioxide levels
at Agra as a result ot the refine. Y IS nOl mo,e than
two micrograms per cubic melre.

cal data indicate that ine frequency of
wind direction towards Agra during the winter months vari~ from
14 to 28 per cent durmg the winter. Out of this percentage, the frequency Of condttlons which prevent the dispersal of pollutants due to stable conditions is approximately 2.0 to 4.0 per cent for Agra This imp~les that
the probability of Joint conditions of favourable northwes~rly windS
towards Agra. and slabl(> atmospheriC
conditions In winter. is hkely to be small.
