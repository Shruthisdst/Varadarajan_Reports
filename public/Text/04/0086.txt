Based on the studies using the- above data, the
Report covers the following asr"cds:
The month with highe~t speed j" June and lowest
~ November. The frequency of 36 km/hr speed is
highest in the month of June (1.2 % ).

\Vind Speed less than 6 km/hr is excluded (The distance of 40 km from
Aj!ra to Refinery implies that wind speed
below 6 km/hr will not effect monuments
nod it requires several hours to reach the
monument zones. A~ per data. nvailable
from 1965 to 1974).
(iii) Meteorological parameters measured at
New Deihi are representative of MathuI4

Wind Steadincs.t
Only for Wcst-North-Wcst direction the wind
steadiness data nt New Delhi have been studied.
Steadiness more than six hoursf OCC!Jrs only for wind
speed more than 2R 1cm/hr. The most frequent wind
speed is 4 km/hr for the steadiness of 2 hours.
