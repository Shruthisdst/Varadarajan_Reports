Where Uo is the wind speed measured at the anemometer level (Zo),
usually 10 m above ground level. Opinions differ OD tbe appropriate value of n, but n = 0.25 for unstable and n â€¢ 0.50 for .table
conditions bave been recommended (Perkin. loc. cit). Numerical
computationa to asseS8 the vertical variation of tb~ wind .peed are
presented in the next section.
The computations in this study are based on the surface windl
of Delhi which is 140 km away from the site of the proposed refinery
site. Unfortunately, Dines anemographs of Agra were available to U8
for only one year. They were not of the same atandar.d of reliability
as Delhi. However, to compare o~r results wit~ -those of Agra, We
used the one year Agra Data to compute the relative frequencies.
We also present in the next section concentration eatimatea
with the wind data of Yadras, where a refinery already exists. The
object of these computations is to verify, at a future date, the
concentrations computed for a Gaussian plume with actual field
measurements. This could provide an idea of the validity, or otbe~
wise of the present computations, although such a verification
programme would be vitiated to some extent by the humid environment,
and different wind regime of Madras.
