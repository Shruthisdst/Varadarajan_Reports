SU l.IMARY AND CO NCLUS IONS

It must be emphasized that the present study is
haudicapped by lack of field data under Indian conditions.
We have used formulations for the diffu'sioD coeft'icients,
and the power law for wind profiles" which ar.e use'd tn
extra-tropical latitudes.
It is not clear how far these
values would be applicable io India} without further field
experiments.
Despite this limitation, the main conclusions
of the study may be summarised as follow~ :
