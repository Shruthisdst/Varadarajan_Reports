The long term cone ell tra ti on val ues for the above three
stack heights. are given in Appendix IV.
As it will be observed from the values in Appendix IV, the peak concentrations
are observed in Janua~y and August at an approximate distance
of 2 km from the stack. The values of the peak concentration
are 122.8 and 97.4 ~g/m3 respectively for January and August â€¢
.At a distance of 40 km downwind the concentration values are
3.9 and 3.5tLg/m3 respectively for January and August. The
prevailing wind is predominently northeasterly in January,
while in August the winds are largely westerly.
In the
computations shown in Apre~dix IV, mean wiqds of Madras for
a 5-year period (1968-72)- were used.
We did not use a power
law for these computations. If a power law had been USCG,
lower concentrations could be expected.

BACKGROUND AND PERitISSIliLE LEVELS OF SULPliUR DIOXIDE

6.1
The global background level of Sulphur-dioxide in the
atmosphere varies from 2.6 to 5.2 Mg/m 3 .
Thus, we can
reasonably assume thn t the level of -8_ulphur-di ox1 d~ al ready
in the air in Agra would be of the order of 5 A.Lg/m) or more
due to local industries.
NEERI is actually analysing the
air samples to have realistic estimates of the present.
sulphur-dioxide at Agra. This background estimates of sulphur dioxide .ill have to be added to our estimates of sulphur-dioxide from Mathura Refinery to have the realiatic
estimates.

6.2

The prescribed standards for sulphur-dioxide in different countries express the concentration of this gas a8 averages
over peri ode of time ra,nging fr.om 1 hour to 1 year.
In general,
the tolerable concentration for 1 hour period could be fairly
high,but when averaged over one year the level is substantially
reduced.
