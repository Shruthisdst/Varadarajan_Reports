Numerous studies of diffusion coefficients have been mnde
in recent year8.
This ia perhaps the mqat uncertain parameter in
diffusion studies, because there is very little information on
its value for large distances down wind from the stack. Turner
(1970) tabulated values otcrz for seven classes of atmospheric
stability, and five categories of wind 8peed. These categories
are shown in table 2.

Figure 1 shows a comparison between the values of McElory
and Turner for OZ. The lower values of
for a very stable .atmosphere are of interest, because they would tend to make our
computations slightly ~ver-estimate the sulphur dioxide
concentration.

Very little is known ab~ut the accuracy of these values.
Turner (1970) states: "In the stable and unstable cases several
fo Id errors in the es tima te of
can occur for the longer
travel distances. In some cases,
may be expected to be
correct within 8 factor ~f 2.
These are: (i) all stabilities
for a distance of travel out to a few hundred metres; (ii) ~nÂ­
sta~le
conditions in the lowest 1000 metres of atmosphere with
a marked inversion above for distances out to 10 km or more."
