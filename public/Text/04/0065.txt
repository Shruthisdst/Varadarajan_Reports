(a) Power Law

As indicated in e.qlJation (4.9 ), a power law was used to
determine the wiud (U) at the level of the stack height.
We were

mainly concerned with aacertainib.g the effect for worat meteorological conditions. Consequently, we used n - 0.50 in (4.9) to
represent stable conditions. The' compu.tations show that the use
of the power law decreased the concentration values. The numerical value of the ratios.

Table 5 indicates that the concentration values
witho~t 8 power law should be multiplied by a factor of
about O.~ to obtained the concentration at ~O km and by a
factor of about 0.65 to obtain the corresponding peak

concentration. The use of a power law would thu8 diminish
the concentration values by approximately a factor of
tor stack heights between 60 and 80 m.
