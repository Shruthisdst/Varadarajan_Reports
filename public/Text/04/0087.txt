-----------------------------------according to Tecncco,
bas·:d on their experience, calculated "Short term value
of SO: concentrations are about 10 to 25 times higher
than actual measured ones. This i ... c'>"cntially due
to the assumption that wind speeds apd directions will
remain unchanged for long periods whereas in actual
practice steadiness of wind even in stablo conditions
is limited to 2 hours in the Mathura case.
