In our computations we have used 1.6 for the ~onstant;but the

1.32 instead of 1.6.

There is divergence of opInion about the plume rise at

only F and U need be considered for large distances. In
this report, we hav~ used a formulation due to Briggs (1969)
in which equation (4.6) is used upto a critical distance xl,
but subsequently tile downstream distances were weighted by a
constant factor. Tile critical distance,is approximately ten
times the stack height. As we arc mainly interested in estimating the heigbest concelltration of sulphur dioxide in the
worst meteorological cQnditions, we will be hereafter concerned
with only a stable atmosphere.
