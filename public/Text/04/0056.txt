To estimate the impact of uncertainties in input data
on sulphur dioxide concentration, it is convenient to introduce the variable.

This enab lea us to c onsi der, in turn, the impact
of errors in (a) meteorological data and stack characteristics, and (b) in

Thus, it will be observed
that the variable C is largely dependent on meteorological
data and stack characteristics (Q) , while
