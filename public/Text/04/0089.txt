2.1 PresclIl SWillS oJ PreSClTatiOlI 0/ MOlluments
Chapter 1 of the report gives a brief introduction
of the work carried out by M/s. Tecneco. This third
and final report completes the studies carried out by
!vi/s. Tecn.:t:o for the. prescrvation of monuments jl~
Agra from l\lathura Refinery Air-Pollution. To carry
out the studies M/s. Tecneco had secured the help of
Scientists and Specialist" from some of the Research
Organisations in Italy and particularly Institute Centrale del Restauro in Rome. This is probably the
first time that such types of studies arc carried Ollt
and as such no prevIOus reference was available to
correlate concentration of pollutants and the degree
of degradation of the stone monuments. The stut.l!es,
thcrefore, were carried out using the basic knowledge
available.
2.2 Collectioll of Samples (Chapter 2 of the Report)
2.2.1 In order to estahlish the present status of prcservation of the monuments, M/s. Tccneco had ctll~
lectcd stolle and dust samples from the monuments.
Two on the site inspections were made to seleet the
monuments to he ('x:ll11incd in Agra Zone Hull

the study to the three monuments namely, Taj Mahal,
Agra Forl and Akbar Tomb.
