The values obtained by (4.8) are greater by 8 factor
of about 2.5. Thus (4.8) provides lower valuea of the
concentration downstream from the stack.

It is not clear up to what distances equation (4.8)
could be reasonably expected to hold; but in the next section

In this report, 8 menn value of the wind speed U bas

this would be to use a time averaged wind speed at the stack
heIght.
