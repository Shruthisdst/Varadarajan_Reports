OBSERVATIONS BY THE COMMITTEE
Based on the various studies initiated by it and
inlormation furnished to it, the Committee has the
'follcwing observations to make:
3.1 Studie:, by NEERI
3.1.1 NEERI were entrusted with the work of
measuring the existing air qualIty of Agra region
with particular reference to the levels of pollutants
at Agra fo~ 15 months covering two winters and one
summer. They commenced the studies on 19th
November ~ 975 and completed the same in March
1917. They had established 5 air monitormg stations, one dr.h at Taj Mahal, Agra Fort, Sikandar~,
Itmat-Ud-I>~uldh and Nagar Mahapalika. Tile malO
pollutants ~lionitored were sulphur dioxide, suspended
particulate 'latter and oxid~3 of nitrogen. The wind
speed and direction measurements were also simultaneously ~ iken. On the basis of this it has been
observed C!at there is substantial sulphur dioxide
pollution existing at Agra, the long term concentration level Jeing in the region of 15 to 20 micrograms per cubiC metre. NEERI have been submitting perio<'lc reports of their. investigations. The
reports arc given in Annexure-V.
Summary ..If their reports is given hereafter:
3.1.2 T;·e report for the period from 19th November, 1975 :0 29th February~ 1916 indicates that 24hourly me,~n value for sulphur dioxide is around
20 micrognms per cubic metre at most of the stations except at the Agra Fort. The Agra Fort value
reaches th<; level of 40 micrograms per cubic metre.
The concentration of nitrogen oxides at different
stations must of the time were found to be close to
the lowe<;t detectable level. It may, therefore,
be
eondud~d that the nitrogen oxide is negligible.
The
results of 24-hourJy sampling for suspended particulate matter ranges from 450 micrograms per cubic
metre in November and December to 250 micrograms
per cubic metre in January and February. AU
the
five sites have more or less recorded the same level
of particulate matter.
3.1.3 NEERl's second quarterly report for the
period March, April & May 1916 show~ that monthly
average 24-hourly mean value for sulphur dioxide is
around 10 micrograms per cubic metre at moc;t of
the c;talion<; except for Agra Fort where the value has
gone to 34 micrograms per cubic metre in Apnl
1976. Sulphur dioxide level in summer <;ea<;on ic;
Jow compared to winter sca~on because of high !emperature c ,nt'iti("1<' of the $umme~ wh,en t~11. po~~u­

duriDl this period. Suspended particulate level is
measured on 24-hour ba~ls and observed to be higher
than those recorded during winter. The Summer
values are tound to be in the order of 350-500 microgramms per cubic metre. T~ese higher values ar~
attributable to the stormy and dusty weather which.
prevails in this area.
3.1.4 NEERl's third quarterly report gives monsoon and post-monsoon data coJJected for the period
June to Odober !976. Sulphur dioxide level wa$
very low during monsoons (J une to September
1916). The reccrded values are below 10 micro..
grams per cubic m~tre.
The month of (>Ctobt;,
(post-monsoon) sh~wed a rise in sulphur dioxide
level The 24-h~' average values recordtxl ranged
from 15 to 26 micrograms per cubic metre.
3.1.5 NEERrs fourth quarterly report gives winter data collected for the period November 1976 to
January /977. Sulphur dioxide concentration (24hour average value) varied from It micrograms per
cubic metre at Sikandara to 56 micrograms per cubic
metre at Agra Fort. Su~pended particulate matter
concentrati{'ln varied from 170 to 400 micrograms
per cubic metre.
3.1.6 NEERrs fifth quarterly report covenng the
period February and March 1977 reeortic; \ulphur
dioxide concentration (24-hour average ) hctw~en
9 to 29 micrograms per cubic metre. Suspended parti.
culate matter was varying from 174 to 388 micro.
grams per cubic metre (24-hourly average).
3.1 7 Air quality data at Taj Mahal during
tht
period from November t 975 to March 1977 indicate
that sulphur dioxide concentration ranges from 7 to
42 micrograms per cubic metre (24-hour average)
and the 2 hour maximum values range from 20 tc
J60 micrograms per cuhic metre. Suspended partie
culate matter ranges from 66 to 448 microgr,101S per
cubic metre (24-hour average) and 24-hour m,lximunl
range from 106 to 803 micrograms per cubIC metre.
The aflnual average sulphur dioxide level ranges
from 15 to 20 micrograms per cubic metre.
