bemg computed for 4-hourly and 24-hoUily period
from ~h-ese ob,crv~itio.i'. The monthly dVer ••!;C (24
hour) of iulphur dioxide levels was below 15,
micrograms/m1, the maximum that was recorded
being 34 micrograms / 013 at the Agra Fort in April.
2-hourly maximum value of 87 micrograms / m 3 was
recorded at Itmat-ud-Daulah in March. Earlier, during winter, monthly average (24-hour) value was
recorded up to 39 micrograms/m' wiJh
malimum
value of 93 microgl arns / rn" at Agra Fort, 2-hourly
maximum being 18R micrograrns/m' at the same
place. Thu~ the levels of sulphur dioxIDe in summer
were considerably lesser in comparison with those
recorded during winter.
