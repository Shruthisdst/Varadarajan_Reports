Predicted GLes (24 hr avg.) under impact of MR point source lot' winter as well as
summer reflect that the impact zone of 10 ug/m3 rise in background extends upto the the
diistance of 13 Kms. Another range of maximum impact zone for 5 ug/m3 over the background
ambient air level have been extrapolated in this study. The impact zone of 5 ug/m3 extends
even upto 34 Kms. These predictions being most conservative the actual concentrations are
not expected to exceed 5 ug/m3 value. Hence, MR may occassionly cause maximum rise of
5 ug/m3at Bharatpur. Exposure of Agra monuments will be still lower than 5 ug/m3 under
the scenario of normal MR emissions because MR is at 40 Kms from Agra city. However,
any abnonnal MR operating conditions demands immediate shut down ofthe refining process.
The actual monitored long term annual ambient air quality concentrations (trends) at
Taj Mahal vary between 6 to 30 ug/m3â€¢ Only 10 percent observations in a year may exceed
30 ug/m3.
In order to clearly quantify the fractional contribution of MR vis-a-vis other point
sources within APPZ towards over all (total) S02 (recorded ambient air S021evels), tracer
studies have been recommended.
Taj Mahal Degradation Studies
Regarding impact on Taj Mahal ( marble degradation) no study on marble of Taj
Mahal is reported highlighting the exact marble erosion rate at Taj Mahal. In such
circumstances, the bibliography on such studies on world monuments was first perpared and
it was summarised in the report also. (NEERI report, 1993 page 111-12).
Marble erosion rates for ambient concentrations and climatic conditions using material
damage model were calculated & reported in one pUblication ( results summarised in table
enclosed for reference).
Taj marble degradation studies through simulated marble exposure experiment have
been also earlier recommended to evolve the criteria of marble degradation (erosion) rate
and S021evel through exposure budget-response relation studies.
