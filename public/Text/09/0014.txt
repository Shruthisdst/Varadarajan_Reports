Agra from Ferozabad in summer is questionable.

Further the

distance

between

Ferozabad and Agra is two-

thirds the distance between Mathura and Agra.

Hence during winter

season if with 7% winds from Mathura the glc is 5 ug/m3, the glc with

14% of winds and with higher emissions from Ferozabad which is at
two-thirds distance cannot be zero at Taj.

Higher frequencies of winds have to yield high glc.

It is

noted that 14% of winds in winter from Ferozabad yield 0 ug/m3 glc at
Taj and 24% yield 9 ug / m3 during summer at Taj.
when 7% of winds in winter yield 5 ug/m3,

But from Mathura

11% in summer is only

producing 1% ug /m 3 which is contrary to the former result.

On this

account too the data is questionable.
