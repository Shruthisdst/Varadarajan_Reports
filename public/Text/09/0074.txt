low to medium specific gravity and different shades of colour.

Sandstone oCQJrrins at different place has become exfoliated at the surface in most weathered places. Formation of

rounded greenish materials occurring in clustered form occurs
in patches over quartz grains. These may be secondary
deposition of organic Â·masses. Sandstmes contains minute pores.
'fhe occurrence of gypsum wi thin sand stone was not detected.
6. PORE SIZE DISTRIBUTION :

Samples of marble,

sandstooe and

mortar collected from

the monument were tested in Autoscan Meralry Instrusion Porosimeter (Nadel 60 k) made by Quantachrome of USA.
Merwry is forced to intrude into the open pores of the
samples by applying pressure for which high pressure is
required to intrude Into the lower size of pores. The radius
is inversely proportional to the pressure applied which follows
