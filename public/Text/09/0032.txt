from Firozabad industrial zone, whereas from Mathura Refmery direction these
percentages are 7 and I I in winter and summer seasons respectively.

The report submitted in July 1993 by NEERI on Taj Trapezium study to MEF
was based on data collection for six months. The study ""as not extended by
MEF that could have enabled further investigations. The modelling exercise
undertaken during this six month long study brings forth the following:
•

The nlajorcontribution to air pollution in Agra region is from point sources.

It varies between 75 to 80% in summer and winter seasons, respectively.
The contributions from automobi~e activity and domestic fuel combustion
are comparatively lower in the vicinity ofTaj Mahal (Table 1)
•

The contributions from Firozabad industries during summer is 34%

(Table 2). The strategy for reduction in the impacted area was
delineated in the report submitted to the MEF in July 1993.
•

Contribution to·802 at Taj Mahal from the Mathura Refinery is about
26% (Table 2) in winter.

Selection of Appropriate Pollution Control Strategy
Various options on process technology andlor fuel shift were considered before reports

on the topic were submitted to the Hon 'ble Supreme Court. The copies of these reports are
available with the Committee. The situation analysis is as follows:
•

The Hydrocracker Unit (HCU) is a cleaner technology option as on one
hand it reduces the sulfur content of the product (which are consumedin
the region., viz. diesel, kerosene), and on the other excess sulfur present
in the Industrial Fuel Oil (IFO) is recovered upto 95% through Claus
process or 990A, by using the biotechnology route. HCV has been accepted
by the Ministry of Petroleum an~ Naural Gas in its ten points Programme
on March 2, 1995. The commissioning ofHCU shall reduce pollution and
improve the refinery economics.
