presence of gypsum (besides the mineral composition of the sandstone),
atomic absorption data suggest that
some complex sodium salts may also
be present. The large quantity of
NOJ- in these specimens may be of
cultural origin. The emission of particulate matter from refinery emissions
will make these potentially hazardous
salts even more dangerous by facilitating their migration and their con- '
sequent accumul~tion near the stone
"'s'larfaccs.
Existing technology lacks proven
methods for preserving stone structures containing gypsum in the zone of
weathering (8). Because gypsum
commonly accumulates on sculpture
heads. some works are defaced during
gypsum removal. At the International
Meeting on the Restoration of the
Erechthcion (9), methods were suggested to convert gypsum, in situ, to
CaeO) by reaction with C02 in an
autoclave at high pressure and temperature. It was also proposed that the
gypsum be transformed to BaSO.. by
reaction with Ba{OHh. Polymeric
treatments were discussed, but the
degree of development of these methods does not promise complete success
and therefore further research is essential. Following decisions at this
meeting, the caryatids have now been
moved from the Acropolis into a museum.
Cleaning the Taj Mahal is a relatively simple malter. The brownish
discolorations under arches at the Taj
(Figure 6) arc presumably only environmental dust adhering with recrystallized calcite formed by C02 reaction
with marble;. these encrustations
should be mechanically removed. Fine
abrasives should be used to polish the
marble surface. Such an operation
should, i", addition to removing dirt,
give a polish to the marble, increasing
its water repellency. The cleaned
marble surfaces then should be washc..-d
regularly with water to prevent crusting. After cleaning, the marble may be
given a surface treatment with polymeric materials, which act as semipermeable membranes (they do not
absorb atmospheric gases) und un:
rc,i,tunt to UV rudiation (If) ,. Culcite
grains mi~ed in such pul}mcn may be
forced into cracks caused by the ~x­
pan,iun t)( iron attachments to inhibit
