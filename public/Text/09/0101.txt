The marble erosion rate was 2.54 lJelyear when calculaled
00 the basis of annual average values of SO. and NO. obtained
from air quality monitoring data around VM.
The empirical function (model) used above is a linear
function model and have included all the important attributes 8S
air pollutants, relative humidity and the damage due to erosion on
while marble. Predictions show that this marble will erode uplo 1
OlOl in about 320 years when exposed to 30 "glluS SO, and NO,
as per CPCB standard applicable for sensitive area and SO'l. relative
humidity. However, as the monument is having age of hundreds
of years and pollution is only one factor causing sucface damage,
the overall damage shall be higher than the predictions made based
this on model considering air pollution and climate.

4.2.1.2 Damage FUDction for Sandstone and Limestone
Another model for the weathering effect of dry deposition
of Sl)2 on rain sheltered sandstone and limes.tone as well as on
weight loss of unshellcred sandstone and limestonc exposed for one
year exposition of atmospheric pollution have been established by
Luckat (1981) through relatioDships developed based on field exposure
studies.
The seasonal averages of S02 monitored at VM were used
to estimate the dry deposition of 802 (mg 80/m2/day) and for the
802 uptake as well as percent weight loss of sandstone and
limestone. The results indicate that the S02 uptake (rug SOjo12/d)
Cor both the stones were maximum in winter followed by m~nROOn
and summer. The percent loss in weight was also higher in winter
than in monsoon and summer. The annual average results indicate
that S02 uptake was 14.11 and 5.75 mg SOjm2/day by sand!-'lonc
and limestone respectively. While thc percent loss in weight was
0.83% and 1.07(10 respectively for sandstone and limestone. 1~hcRC
