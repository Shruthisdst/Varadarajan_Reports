The cast stone vas manufactured from quartzose aggregate of fine granules and coarse sand; lime-cement was probably used as the bonding medium.
The physical properties of this cast stone are similar to that of a highly porous, poorlY sorted, coarse-grained sandstone.

Therefore,

the be-

havior of the cast stone to weathering Is similar to the behavior of natural,

The effects of

weathering are perceptible even in deeper regions of cast stone.
