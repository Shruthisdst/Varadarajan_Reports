Salient features based on the observations through optical
microscope and pore size distribution.

1.

were generally hard and compact with no
porosity. These were essentially composed of calcite
grains of different sizes with minor presence of muscovite
Marbles

marble. The
wi thin marbles.

Deposition of organic masses over: the surface of marbles
were

very

frequently

observed.

Depositim

of

carbon

particles was very less- in quantity.

2.

Sandstones were essentially composed of quartz with
silicous and clayey cementing material. Sandstones "ere
very prone to weathering and exfoliation. It showed a
wide range of porosity 7-23\ which was respcnsible for
exfoliation due to weathering. Deposition of organic mass
was also seen over the surface of sandstcne.

3.

Mortars

consisted of small grains of calciate in major
amOWlt
and quartz in lesser amount cemented with
calcareous cemS'll. Mortars showed porosity in the range
of 10-12\ though higher porosity was also observed in
places. Within the pores of mortars deposition of gypsum
\\' as observed In places.
