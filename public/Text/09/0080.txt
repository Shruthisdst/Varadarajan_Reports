the exfoliation was much observed over the surface of
the sandstcne which came 1n contact with rain water, or

However,

black patina 1s very common 1n places, specially below

presence of black particles, may be of carboo particles,
and subrounded g reenish cl~s tered mass may be of organic
origin. Green patina was obsel'Ved locally and it was
formed due to formation of copper sulphate. Microscopic
observations of marble did not show any alteration of
calcite grains and occurrence of gypsum within it.
