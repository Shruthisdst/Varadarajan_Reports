On page 2 of the Technical Note Summary provided by

NEERI to the Committee (Annexure II) on 19.3 .1995, it is stated,

"Predicted GLCs (24 hr .avg.) under impact of MR point
source for winter as well as summer reflect that the impact zone of 10
microgram/m3 rise in background extends upto the distance of 13 kms.
Another range of maximum impact zone for 5 microgram / m3 over the
background ambient air level have been extrapolated in this study.
The impact zone of 5 microgram/m 3 extends even upto 34 kms.
