ABSTRACT
Cast stone ornamentAtion and stuccoed surfaces of California Bulldln~.
erected 1n 1915. had deteriorated due to weathering.
Increment of water
absorption, reduction of mechanical stren~th. and cyclical hydration of
efflorescences had accelerated decay. Connecting iron bars had oxidized.
Consequently. cast atone had fragMented In places; these areas needed to
be patched. Heavy ornamentation that was safety hazard had to be replaced
by light weight replicas of artificial stone.
Quantitative specification, developed from labor'lor y experiments. consisted of cleaning efflorescences (reduction of Na
to 0.02 percent of
stone) and consolidating the cast stone with epoxv impregnation (amon~
oth~rst enhance compressive strength bv sot).
Specification for artificial stone made from polymeric cement and inor~anic ag~regate r~lated to
bond and mechanical strength, water absorption, flammability, and linear
expansion; these were determined using ASTH standards. These properti~s
of the fabricated
stone were similar to that of the cast stone.
