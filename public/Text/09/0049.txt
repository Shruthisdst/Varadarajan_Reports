As the minimum quantity of Na

varied from 0.02 to

found In the cast stone was of

the order of 0.02% and this cast stone was not damaged, it vas therefore
specified that after cleaning, the cast stone shall not have more than
0.02% of Na 2+.

It was also later discovered that the British Standards

recommend that best bricks are those In vhich the content of Na

2+

is

less than 0.02%.
The efflorescences were reduced to above specified quantities by the
following procedures:
The stone surface was brushed where efflorescence was apparent by its
white color. The stone surface vas then washed with COMbination of water
and rounded stllca sand at such pressures which did not damage the stone.
This, in addition to re~ovlng some efflorescence. also cleaned the stone
of other dirt.

Where the efflorescences were not reduced to sreclfled

quantity by means of above procedure, the stone surface was repeatedly
treated with stea~ at high pressure followed immediately by w8shinlt with
cold water. After washing, acetone was drtpped down the surface to remove
