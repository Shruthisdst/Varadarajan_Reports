Results :
~!!~

: No open pores were found 1n the samples of
marble 1.e. apparent porosity 1n nearly zero.

Sandstone:
---~--

Some variations 1n the distribution of pores
are found in d~fferent samples of sandstones.
""'' ' It showing much erosioo with exfoliation
Samples
show A.P. 23.19\. In this sampl~ 50\ of the
total open pores were below 0.40 microns
whereas sandstone with white patina. but not
with exfoliation showed A. P. 10.18%. In this
sample 50\ of the total open pore were below
0.55

microns.

The

showing A.P. 7.91\ have 50\ of the total open
pores

below

0.17

microns.

This

sandstClle

showed less weathering.
Mortar:

Generally mortars (Mkd. 2 6 24) showed A.P.
within the range of 10-12\ except the sample
with green patina which showed 18.6\ A.P.
and larger pore radIus alsolFig.14.l5..1,6) Higher
apparent porosity and pore size might be the
cause of high penetration of green copper
