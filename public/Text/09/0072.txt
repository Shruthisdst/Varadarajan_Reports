5. PETROGRAPHIC AND MINERALOGICAL ANALYSIS (UNDER OPTICAL
MICROSCOPE)

Marbles :
Marble 1s commonly

a

light

coloured

metamorphic rock

in. which calcite is the chief coostituent and dolomite is frequently

associated

with it.

Its texture 1s generally

massive

and granular.
Marble chips collected along cracks and joints occurring
at the surface blocks were examined under a polarising microscope. Marble chips essentially consist of calcite, 8S 8 major
mineral and muscovite and quartz. as minor minerals. Most of
the calcite grains are irregular having variable grain sizes.
In

places large angular or irregular grains of calcite occur

within the groundmass of fine calcite grains. Remarkable textural
