: --6The statements made in NEERI report (July 1993) and in
their Technical Note Summary (Annexure II) are inconsistent with what
has been indicated in Table 13 of "Summary Inspection Report (Oct.
16-18,

1993) on S02 emission control measures at Mathura Refinery II

submitted to the Hon I ble Supreme Court.

It is seen from the Report of the Expert Committee on
environmental impact of Mathura Refinery of 1977 that the contribution
from the refinery to the long-term concentration of S02 at Agra would
be of the order of one to two microgram per m3 at Taj Mahal, Agra
(page

of

the

report).

indicated in Table 3.1. 7 at page 261 of the report that the predicted

critical winter season is 1.5 microgram 1m 3 â€¢

The air diffusion models
