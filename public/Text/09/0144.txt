Dear Sir,
We would like to submit the following steps already taken by us
for reducing Emission and also Fuel (Hard Coke) consumption in

foundries of Agra.

We are keen that still better technology be employed to reduce
Hard Coke consumptions.
We have already installed Air Pollution Control System (APeS),
due Co our continuous endeavours for employing better avai~a!le
Techonology to reduce. Pollution & Hard Coke consumptions.
In the process of our continuous efforts in this direction we

have decided to install Divided Blast Cupola t with appropriate
modifications to our existing Air Pollution Gontrol System (APeS)
and accordingly, SPM & S02 level of emissions will further be
reduced, resultl.Ilg in further cleaning the Fnviomment.

In this endeavour, our ASSOCiation! namely; Agra Iron Founders'
Association, 88 North Vijay Nagar ~olony, Agra is in constant
look-out for more positive actions to further cleaner env1or.nment
and bas recently entered into a 'MENORA!IDUH OF UNDERSfANDINGS(MoU)
with USAID that will made available all sorts of helps, in
furthering the cause of s~ill better enviornment.

The cost of such a unit is about ~.5/6 lacs. rhe foundries in
Agra region are very small and with all the problems confronting
it for the last two years, due to stagnancy and their financial
position is in a bad shape.
We would therefore request that a subsidy of 70-80% be given to
the units for improving their mel~1ng system.
