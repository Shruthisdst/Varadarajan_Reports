X-ray dl fractometer 1s an essential tool for mineralogical
studies. In addition to petrographic analysIs XRD analysis have

The analysis has been carried out 1n Philips XRD
generator (Model No. PW 1734). X RD tube was run at 40 KV
20 mA using CuKe( radiation with the help of nickel filter.

Di fractometer run off all the ground samples (-325 mesh)
were taken under the above condition at 2 0 per minute (chart
drive) â€¢ d.B. value of each peak has been taken from the
standard chart. Therefore all the diffraction peaks were
analysed by finger print method with the help of J C P D 5
card index.

It is evident from Table I that in marble calcite occurs
the major mineral. Quartz, dolomite, mica. gypsum and

opaque minerals have been identified as minor minerals. Among
these minor minerals gypsum and opaque minerals are not the
constitutional minerals of marble. Minor constitutional minerals
have also been identified by petrographic analysis. In case
of sandstone constitutional minerals are quartz and clay. Mortar
contains calcite as major mineral and quartz, gypsum as minor
mineral. The deposition of gypsum 1n the pores of mortar is
seen in photomicrographs taken after petrographic analysis :
