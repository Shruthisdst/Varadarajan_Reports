It is noted from pages V-20 and V-30 of NEERI report (July
1993) that the cumulative impact of point, area and line sources for
Agra city at the Taj Maha1 is 13.9 ug/m3 during winter season and
16.4 ug/m3 during summer season respectively.

In the NEERI Report of July 1993 on Air Pollution Studies

to Redefine Taj Trapezium Co-ordinates, certain assumptions on extent
of coal/coke consumption by Agra Industries were made (Annexure VI).
The figures were apparently based on information provided by
Agra.

DIC,

The data from DIC were used by NEERI in their Report for all

categories

of

industries

(Ferro

Alloys,

Chemical,

Rubber

Sole,

Refractory bricks, Engineering, Line processing) with the exception of
Ferrous Casting (Foundries).

In the case of Foundries alone (Table

4.3 in Page IV-7 of July 1993 NEERI Report) reproduced in Annexure
VI, the estimate of consumption of coke I coal in normal operation of 26
units is given as 208 MTPD.
