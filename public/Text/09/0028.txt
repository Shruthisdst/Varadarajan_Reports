EUlissions

Short tCfln concentrations at Agra varies ironl 47 to 65 ughn 3 ( for one ton per hour
elllissions) 'while long tenn seasonal concentrations varied frotn 0.6 to 1.0 uglrn3 ( 1 ton per
hour) as per the results of IIv1D study on dispersal of pollutants 1'r01n the refinery using

l11eteorological data collected at the Mathura observatory (Expert C0111n1ittee Report on
Environnlental Irnpact of Maihura Refinery, 1977 page no. 79)
NEEIU Predictions for Pollution }lrof1le at Taj I\lahal, Agra :
Two scenario's for industrial clnissions viz. worst case, when all the industries are
operating and normal case when only 26 foundries (20 % of 131) along with all other type
industrial wilts are operating, have been generated for prediction purpose. Industries nonnally

operated for 8 hrs duration in one shift.
" Predicted GLes at diHerent sensitive receptors: Taj Mahal, Etuwd-ud-daula, Agra
fort and Sikandara are 49, 30, 21 and 2.9 ughn 3 under worst conditions and decline to
11,10,9.3 (uld 3 ughn 3 at the smnc sites rcvcctivcly under nonnaI cunditions. The iSOlllC1.ric
and isopleth projections of S02 : 24 hrs avg. concentrations for Agra city under worst case
before source control inlplelnentation and under two nonnal cases : before and after
itnplenlentation of source 11litigation schclne for \vinter as well as SUtlUllCr seasons are
developed. These concentrations at Taj Mahal do not include contribution due to tvlR reHnery.

In cO~l1parison to. winter season the SUlluner season GLCs at sensitive receptors: Taj
~Iahal,

EtInad-ud-daula, Agra FOJi, and Sikandara \-vere in general, lo\ver under extrelne

eluission conditions as \vell as nornlal industrial operation schedule. As far as 8 Ius
concentrations are concerned (for one shift at1l0ng three), day titne schedule result in niuch
IO'wer GLCs than night hours.
