and irregular flakes of muscovi te 01 variable sizes and a few
small grains of quartz occur as inclusions within calcite grains.
Scrapping samples In the form of powder collected from
different places, viz., black patina, white patina etc. were
also examined under the optical microscope. Scrappings from
black patina zone contain angular grains of small calcite and
brownish/greenisi, rounded material clustered together. These
materials may be organic materials deposited over the surface
of marble. Minute black carbonaceous material were seen
scattered wi thin the powder samples. The occurrence of gypsum
in marble chips and scrappings were not detected in petrographic study. The photomicrographs of marble samples were shown
in figures 1 to 6.

Mortars essentially consists of small angular to irregular
calcite grains and a few small angular quartz grains bonded
with fine calcareous materials (probably lime or CaO). These
