stone had ruptured in certain areas.
The effects of weathering not physically expressed but responsible for
above visible effects are:
1. Reduction of abrasive index
2. Reduction of the mechanical strength of the weathered cast stone. and
3. Increment of th~ rate of water absorption and the total

absorption

of water by the cast stone.
The ob1ect of the. preservative treatment was to recover these pronerties
so that the stone became. at least partially, regenerated.
