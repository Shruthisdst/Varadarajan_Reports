In lA.~mbcr 1978, the senior (lirst)
authur of this paper collecled a few
marble samples at \he Taj Maha1 to
cumpare their condition with the
marbles exposed at the Field Museum
of Natural Hislory in Chicago and the
Erechtheion at the Acropolis in Ath·
ens. Knowledge of the me~hanisms of
marble decay enables the conclusion
,hal the mllrbl~ at the TuJ MahuJ-in
'he wake of the crnucntl of industrial
~ombultlon expected to pervade the
environment of Asra-shaU meet the
samc fatc as the monuments of antiquity in industrial Europe and North

America.

Of constituents produced by ahe
combustion of fossil fuels, NO... and
SOl are the most polent for stone
decay. During periods of dryness. they
accumulate as particulate matter on
stone surfaces and are activated by
subsequent wetness. Dissolved in precipitation, they descend as acid solutions, In the eastern U.S .• the acidity
of precipitation has achieved a regional
pH value below four (2). In the Los
Angeles Basin. similar pH values exist

due to acid nitrates (J).
