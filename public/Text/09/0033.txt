The option of import of low sulfur IFO needs techno-availability analysis.
The ultimate solution is in the use of Natural Gas (NG).

•

The improvement in the quality of products after the commissioning of
HCU will be substantial, viz. reduction in diesel '8' from I to 0.5%, and
the distribution of these products in the Agra-Mathura region shall effect
reduction of S02 emission load in the region.

•

Sulfhur content in IFO could be brought down from the level of 0.7 % wt
to about 0.4% wt by, processing 50:50 Low Sulfur Heavy Stock (LSHS)
mix of crude at the refmery. Further reduction in sulphur content ofIFO
to a level of 0.20-0.30% wt could be possible if crude mix is changed to
60:40 LSHS : low sulpbur crude from NigerialBombay High.

•

In the event of reliable electric power made available in Agra region, the
use of diesel generating sets shall be drastically reduced as more than

70% of the commercial units were found using diesel sets during the
MEF study period due to frequent power cuts.

NEERI bas designed air pollution control technology packages for aU
major small/medium scale industrial sectors after considering diffemt
options. The packages include the cost of fabrication for typical emission
characteristics. The generic design packages were submitted to the local
industrial association, State authorities, and the Hon 'ble SC in September
& October, 1993 for possible implementation to enable around 80%
reduction in the polluting industries.
