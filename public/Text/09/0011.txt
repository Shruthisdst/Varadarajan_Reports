to 1873 MPTD.

the

In the NEERI Technical Report dated March 7 1994 to

Hon I ble Supreme Court in Table 3, the total coall coke fuel is

given as 1873 MPTD and no reference is made to the actual consumption
of 743 MTP D.

The emission values are estimated on the basis of the

higher fighre of 1873 MPTD.

Presumably the higher estimate was used

in the Technical Report of March 7, 1994 to calculate the maximum
amount of alternative fuels such as NG, LPG and propane required.

IMPAGT-0F-AGRA-INDHSTRIES

In the NEERI Report of July 1993 estimates of coke I coal usage
by Agra Industries in Tables 4.3 (page IV-7) in normal operation is
stated as 328 MTPD of which 26 Foundries account

for 208 MTPD.

In

projection of usage contained in page IV-I0, it is assumed that all 283
Inqustries

Units

including

131 Foundries would be working and the

coal! coke consumption would be 1247 MTPD, of which 131 Foundries
account

for

consumption

of

1048

MTPD.

The

emissions

from

Agra

industries are estimated on the basis of coal! coke consumption of 1247
MTPD in 1993 and 1258 MTPD in year 2001 due to small increase in
Rubber Processing and Lime Processing Industries, taking total number
of units to increase to 283

in

year 2001 from the number of 305 in
