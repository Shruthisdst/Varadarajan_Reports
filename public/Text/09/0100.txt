4.2.1.1 Damage Estimations lor VM Marble
11le literature available on the models on cause and effect
relationship for a building malcrials (slone) and ambient pollution
exposure conditions is very limited. One \\~cll documented model was
evolved for the physical damage as a dalnage function for a while
marble stone exposed to polluted atmosphere (major pollulants SO
N02 etc.) with varied controlcd conditions of relative humidity by
Haynie. Spence and Upham (1976).

In this model loss-in-weight is a parameter used for assessing
the magnitude of damage caused by Ute pollutants. It is assumed
that water soluble reaction products are constantly removed from
the surface of exposed specimens due to maintenance/cleaning or rain
washout and primarily account for the loss-in- weight. Each loss..
in-weight value ,converted to an equivalent thickness of calcium
carbonate and expressed as an erosion rate-loss in thieknes.c; uniLc;
per year (JLmlyr). The assessment methodology employed in this model
provides a tQoI for obtaining estimates of monthly or even annual
material losses attributable to the meao pollution exposilion.
