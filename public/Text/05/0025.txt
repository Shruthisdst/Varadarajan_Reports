2.3.5

An annual schedule of preventive maintenance is prepared
but the power stations are not able to adhere to this schedule because of frequent unscheduled outages. Some of the
pending maintenance tasks are performed during such unscheduled outages. The sets, by and large, are made available
when scheduled for maintenance. At times, shortages of
spare parts has resulted in a delay in the maintenance schedule. But the spares position is now improving.

2.3.6

The suppliers of equipments have given only general guide
lines On maintenance. However

G.E~B.

prepares its own ma-

intenance schedules based on past experience.
2.3.7

The targets for completion of maintenance works are set,
but because of unexpected repairs or other difficulties,
they are usually delayed. As against the norm of 4 weeks
for boiler overhaul, and 80 days for turbogenerator overhaul, the recent experience in G.E.B. has been 30 to 40
days for boilers and 115 to 125 days for turbogenerators.
The delays are due to several reasons. Poor finish of the
bolts are said to cause delays in opening up the sets. When
unexpected problems arise, the BHEL personnel at site
being too junior have to refer problems to their head office
and delays result. Incorrect or inadequate clearances and
warping due to manufacturing defect or operations at uneven temperatures result in additional problems. Even where
the capacity of sets are identical, many parts are not
interchangeable and considerable time is taken in modification of such parts.
