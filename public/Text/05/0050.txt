Thus the causes of forced outages and their duration vary
considerably.

It is therefore necessary to consider a

number of factors leading to forced outages and remedy
them.

Chapters II and III have discussed operations

and maintenance practices and the design and reliability
of equipment respectively.

Principally, the Committee

fe8ls that the following other areas need attention:
a)
b)
c)

Instrumentation and Cont~ol
Spare parts management
Quality of coal.
