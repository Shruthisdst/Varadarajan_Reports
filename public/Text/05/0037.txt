Drum leval control:

BHEl have given several different

instructions for maintaining drum levels.

This has also

resulted in heavy carry-over and on ocoas10n the level
suggested was so low that there was starvation and
boiler tubes failed due to overheating.

A oopy of

SHEL's letter is included in Appendix-12 which shows
that the instructions were revised many times.
3.2.5

flame failure tripping:

The flame failure trip-outs

have been far too frequent especially on 200MW units and
once the unit trips it takes 12-16 hours before it oan
be re-synchronized.

This is causing heavy load shedding

during the period of such tripping.

Wedges of Rotor:

The wedges of generator rotor of

120MJ sets have been getting displaced.

This causes

ultimately results in severe vibrat i011.

This may be due

to poor quality of material and 'Jorkmanship in assembly.
The repairs of such defects is time consuming and
reduces availability of the unit.
3.2.7

Wedges of Stator:

The wedges of Stator of 120MW units

get loose whenever it is taken out for overhaul.

This

defect has not been found in imported units.
3.2.8

Tube Puncture:

There have been frequent tube failu~es

in 120MW and 200MW units.

This may be either due to

bad material or poor quality control or poor design.
After commissioning, the number of tube failures
