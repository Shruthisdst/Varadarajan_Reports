Financial pr8ctices.

6.6.1

The Committee recommends that the budgetary and costing
systems and financial practices Df the Board

sh~uld

be

oriented towards getting adequate returns from invested
resources rather than towards only providing services.
6.6.2

Currently only fuel accounting is dono at ouch station
and other inputs for power generation, staff and spare
parts are not

c~stod

separntely.

The committee underst-

ends that a costing system haa boen d8vGlop~d (Appendix-B)
t8 account for cost of generation of power at each station but is not completely imploment8d because of a lack
of cost consciousnqss

am~ng

This co-

sting system, with appropriate modifications if n8cessary, should be implemwnted.

6.6.3

Currently maintennnce budgets are prepared on an adhoc
basis.

Therefore,

budgetary control of maintenance is

almost non-8xistGnt.

A rational basis for preparing

budgots for preventive maintGnanc8 noeds to be evolvod
