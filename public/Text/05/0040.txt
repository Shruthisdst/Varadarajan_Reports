It is necessary to stop the unit very

frequently to attend to such defects.

Gland sealing steam temperature:

As per recommendation

of SHEL, when 200MJ units were oommissionmd, the gland
sealing steam temperature was maintained between 120 0
to 150°C.

After sometime different instructions were

given by BHEL and now it is recommended that temperature
should be maintained between 180°C to 200°C.

The fre-

staff to get confused.

Auxiliary steam temperature and

pros~ure-contrbl:

The

actuators of auxiliary steam temperature and pressure
control could not be oommissioned in 200MW units.

BHEl

had intimated GEB that the manufacture of this type of
actuator was :discontinued
GEB now has to make some

Breaking of piston rings of Cont-ol Valves:

The piston

Vacuum problem:

This is very dangerous.
In 200MlJ units, two ejectors are requ-

ired to be run continuously_

Thus, no standby is

available.

Sticking of diaphragm liner of LP top cover:

In 200MW

unit III, the diaphragm liner was stuck up and
manhole had to be out in the top cover to detach
