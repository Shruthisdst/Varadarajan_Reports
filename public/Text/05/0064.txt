-53Since the problem of getting qualified personnel to work
in remote areas is likely to continue, the Committee recommends that the deficiencies in formal qu~lif!eations
be rectified through training.

5.2.5

The Committee observed that at the higher levels of the
power station hierarchy in GEB, engineers with little
or no exposure to management training or exposure were
being placed in critical management positions.

While su-

ch persons might be technically competent, the Committee
felt that engineers who are holding or are likely to
hold important managerial positions should be designated
as managers and also given basic training in management
concepts.

Selection of persons to head power stations

should be based more on the administrative and managerial abilities of individuals rather th8n their technical proficiency alone.
