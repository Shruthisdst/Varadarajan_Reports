-52to say that the requirement of engineers will far exceed
the availability.
5.2.3

The numbers of qualified engineers employed per shift in
the operation side of power stations in GEE,
Tata Power Co. are at Appendix-16.

&

A.E.Co.,

It appears that GEB

employs a larger number of qualified engineers per shift
per unit than either Tatas or A.E. Co.
The Committee therefore recommends that GEE review its
staffing patterns to ensure that engineers are only employed on jobs where their training and skills are essential.
Secondly, for jobs where formal education in engineering
can be dispensed with, GEE cou1d recruit science graduates with the necessary aptitudes, and subject them to
post recruitment training.
5.2.4

The quality of the technical personnel in the GEE power
stations in terms of their qualifications is in Table-II.
A.E. Co.

have reported that most of their officers are ei-

ther degree or diploma holders.
