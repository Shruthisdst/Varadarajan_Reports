Programmes of training abroad in cGunt~ies from which the
relevant power technology has been imported, should be
arranged in an or~anise~ manner.

The Co~~ittee recommends

that instead of individual engineers being sent for such
programmes, teams of engineers both operations and maintenance should be sent to work in foreign power stations,
so that some of the working culture can also be absorbed.

5.5.1

The rapid advances in technology have thrown up new needs
in terms of specialised knowledge and skills.

As discuss-

Then Committee felt that this may be an

important contributory factor resulting in poor performance of the Instrumentation and Control Systems at both

constitutes a specialist cadre of instrument engineers.
However, lateral entries of suitably qualified personnel
