seldom adequate for a study of the nature entrusted to the
committee, invited both the Chairman, G.E.B and the Chief
Executive, A.E. Co. to make oral presentations to supplement
the written replies to the questionnaire. These presentations are summarised in tho minutes of discussion at
Appendix-3.

The Committee also undertook visits to the Gandhinagar,
Ukai and Ahmedabad power stations using indigenous sets.
To compare the performance and practices of these with importod sets visits were also paid to the Dhuvaran T.P.S.
of the G.E.B and the Trombay T.P.S. of the Tata Power Co.
in Maharashtra. During these visits and subsequent visits
by a sub-committee of the main committee, opportunity was
taken for discussing a variety of problems with the local
engineers.

Since a numbor of problems faced in the operation of indigenous sets were attributed to design deficiencies and poor
after-sales service by Mis BHEL, a meeting was also arranged on 1.7.82 @t New Delhi with Shri K.L. Puri, Chairman
of BHEL to hear his views on the subject. The minutes of
the meeting are at Appendix-6.
