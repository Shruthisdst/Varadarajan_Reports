2.3.8

A maintenance information centre at each power station is
being set up. it has a record of past maintenance for each
piece of equipment. Once sufficient information on maintenance is accumulated and analysed, it would result in better predictability of need for maintenance and for spare
parts. So far the information centres have been working for
only a few months and hence the Committee was unable to
assess its functioning.

2.3.9

Maintenance costing is done on the basis of past experience.
The scheduled maintenance work is costed on the basis of
estimated cost of spare parts. The maintenance staff are
usually part of the regular staff and mayor may not be
costed separately. The estimates for cost of unscheduled
outages are based on past experience.

2.3.10 The Plant layouts do not always facilitate maintenance.
For instance, the layout of oil piping at Gandhinagar and
of H.P. heater, BF pumps, CE pumps, economiser and superheater at Ukai have made maintenance difficult. The Committee
suggests that these aspects are kept in mind when new power
station layouts are designed.
2.4.0

Review of implementation of earlier committee recommendations.

2.4.1

Several committees have examined the problems of maintenance of thermal sets, in particular the Kulkarni Committee
Report (1975), the VGB Committee Report (1977) and Rajadhyaksha Committee Report (1980)

In addition to its own

independent evaluation, this committee also reviewed the
progress made by GEE in the implementation of these earlier recommendations. The findings were as follows:
