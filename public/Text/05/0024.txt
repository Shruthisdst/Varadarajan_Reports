-13instrument technician should be available in each shift
and he should report to the shift charge engineer. He could
identify the instruments which are not functioning whenever
a discrepancy is noticed. This would improve the reliability of measurements.
2.3.2

Many automatic controls are operated manually which is not
a good operating practice. The unreliability of measurements due to defective instruments and nan-functioning controls have led to this

pra~tice.

Once instruments and con-

trols are functioning properly (Ch. IV) this practice should be checked.
2.3.3

The Committee found that while a lot of data on operating
conditions is collected, it is not analysed. The amount of
data and the routineness of operations naturally lead to
such neglect. Only when some problems occur, this data is
examined. The Committee recommends that a small computer
should be made available at each station which can be used
to process this data.

It should

data at the control room, analyse the same, produce warning signals and prepare a summary report of each day's conditions for distribution among plant personnel.

The Committee also examined the record of operating conditions aver a specified period. It concluded that within
the limitations introduced by design, instrumentation,
spares and quality of coal, which are discussed in
Chapters III
