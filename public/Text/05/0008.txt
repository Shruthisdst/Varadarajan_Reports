that in the last two years the value of the spares supplied to the different power stations has gone up from
Rs. 50 crores to Rs. 110 crores.
However, it is necessary
that the power stations should plan their spares procurement, as supply of spar8s at short notice, especially,
for imported and long lead ~tems is not possible.
In
spite of our proposal to CEA for alloting money to maintain a pool of spares no funds have yGt b0en allocated
and 'as such it is not possible for BHEL, on its own, to
stock spares to cater for emergency requirements.
However, BHEL is prepared to send officers dealing with spares
management in the Company to the different power stations
to assist GEE in planning and ordering of spares.
It was also agreed that we will critically examine
each specific complaint of high pricing and-make revision
if warranted.
A set of catalogues of spares in which prices are held firm for one year was also shown to the Members of the Committee.

Reliability of design Quality of equipment

Regarding the charge that sometimes equipment of un~
proven design ara SUpplied, BHEL may reiterate that 911
the designs are provon designs of collaborators and in
case some of them have not proven their reliability, it
was mainly on account of Indian conditions being different
from those prevailing in the countries of original manufacture.
BHEL however is always taking necessary steps to
ensure that th8 defective equipments are corrected.
Regarding PA fans, it was mentioned by us that the
impellers in the first set of PA fans which gave some problems at a number of earlier commissioned stations, are
being replaced with impellers of lower weight and the
same are expeoted to give more reliable service~

Availability of drawings

Regarding availability of drawings for manufacture of
SpS+BS, BHEL's stand is that only spares of low technology could be manufactured outside BHEL works.
Drawings of
such components would be supplied to GEB as and when reqU$t~d.
