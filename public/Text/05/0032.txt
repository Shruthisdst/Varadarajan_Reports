The most important action required is to shift gradually
from crisis based maintenance to a planned system Qf maintenance. A variety of managerial steps are required to
bring about such a shift. First the targets set for availability of sets should be realistic. Secondly, a running
list should be maintained for maintenance tasks on and
actions to upgrade the performance of boiler, turbine and
especially instrumentation systems-

Finally, when a set in

any particular quarter has exceeded its targetted availability, it should be given a scheduled outage to perform such
maintenance tasks. Over a period of time, this would result in a better balance between scheduled and unscheduled
outages and a reduction in the total length of outages.

2.5.1

The analysis of the causes of outages is difficult for

analysis

several reasons, as listed below. Some of the instruments
are not working and therefore reliable measurements may
not be available. Sequential event recorders are not installed and instead the data is logged every four hocrs.
It is difficult therefore to reconstruct the history of
operating conditions when the outage occurs. The usual
data recorded on water, gas condition and coal analysis
may not be sufficient to diagnose the real causes of pro-
