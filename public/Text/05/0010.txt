Dear Shri Samat,
Kindly recall our telephonic conversation yesterday on
the subject of BHEL's response to the points raised by the
Varadarajan Committee and communicated to Shri K.l. Puri
in Dr. Varadarajan's letters dated 26 May and 22 June, 1982.
You had indjcatod that gist of discussions held on 1 July,
1982 had already been sent to Dr. Varadarujan and no further
information was required to be sent by BHEL.
I had explained to you that ~nless a detailed response to the points
raised by the Committee w~s received, the Committee would
hove to finalise the report on the basis of the points made
by GEE,alone and this would not be in Lhe interest of BHEL.
I also drew attention to Dr. Varadarajan's letter to 5hri
Puri dated 11 August, 1982 in which he had asked for the
information.
As the Committee is to finalise its report before the
end of this month, I will be gr3teful if any response by BHEL
to tho points raised is sent immediately.
With kind regards,
Yours sincerely,
Sd/( R. BAS U )

Shri B.S. Samat,
Director (TPG),
