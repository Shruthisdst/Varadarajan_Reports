3.4.5

BHEL on its part has already taken th[ following actions:
(a) Spare parts production has doubled in two years and
is likely to increase further, (b) A catalogue of spare
parts with prices and delivery sChedules has been prepared
and printed and (c) Appropriate changes are continuously
being made to incorporate the learning acquired through
operating experiences in India;

some examples of such

modifications are fans, dampers and coal mills.
3.4.6

The issue of bent rotors was discussed.

BHEL engineers

felt that the major reasons were inadequate or incorrect
operating conditions, water ohemistry, water induction in
turbine, instruments being unreliable or not working and
auto controls not working.

There was some difference of

opinion between GEB and BHEL engineers.

GEB engineers

felt that the problems were due to design defects in some
of the equipment, which has taken a long time to rectify.
Although, as remarked earlier, it is difficult to assign
a single cause for an unscheduled outage, it does appear
that tf all instruments and controls were working satisfactorily secondary damage to equipment resulting in
forced outages could have been prevented.
3.4.7

Chairman BHEl gave the Committee a translated verson
of the report of Mr A V Makhnovski, specialist from
USSR who had stayed at the Ukai thermal power station
