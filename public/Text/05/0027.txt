2.4.2

The Kulkarni Committee (1975) made several recommendations
for modernisation of maintenance measures in large thermal
stations. Their major recommendations are summarised in
the report of Rajdhyaksha Committee and the progress against each of these recommendations are discussed below.
a.

A co-ordinated schedule of overhaul of units in the
system should be drawn up at the beginning of the
year in consultation with the State/Regional load
despatch station and the specialised maintenance
agencies in the system. 4.37(1}

This recommendation has been implemented, only minor delays in carrying out scheduled maintenance activities are
experienced.
b.

Meticulous and dotailed planning of scheduled maintenance will enable substantial improvement in the
spced and efficiency of maintenance. 4.37{~)

In G.E.B. the time taken for scheduled maintenance is considerably above the norm. Although informally several expediting actions are taken by engineers in charge of maintenance, opportunities exist for further reduction in down

time. The norms generally suggested were discussed in

2.3.7. A time and motion study of scheduled outages should
be commissioned to identify possibilities for reducing
the down time by allocating more resources in the form of
man power and equipment. The results of this study as well
as previous experience should be used to prepare plans for
scheduled maintenance.
c.

Only those essential items of work which cannot be
done while the unit is running should be included
in the maintenance programme. 4.37(3)

This practice is usually followed.
