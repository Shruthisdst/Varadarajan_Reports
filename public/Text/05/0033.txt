the erosion problems are caused over a long term by operating conditions which are not ideal.
2.5.2

The outage analysis committees have been formed at the
power stations. These committees have been meeting regularly. The outage analysis committee at Gandhinagar found
that the major cause of trippings were due to furnace draft
fluctuations and surge of oil pressure. At Ukai, besides
the major problems for turbines, leaks in economiser, waterwall and superheater tubes have resulted in problems.
The deliberations of the outage committees should be carefully recorded and widely circulated within and outside the
particular power station.

The laboratories at these power stations are insufficiently
equipped compared to those of other established undertakings. The capability for corrosion and metallurgical analysis is also inadequate. Steps should be taken to upgrade

Organisation of maintenance

2.6.1

The operation and maintenance functions have been merged
at each power station and they are usually subgrouped
under various specialisations such as mechanical and electrical. A separate maintenance group is not formed. While
there may be some advantages in separating the maintenance
