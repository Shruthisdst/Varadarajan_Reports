The Committee observed that the present promotion policy
resulted in all engineers stagnating for long periods as

E.E. and S.E. - as long as 15-17 years as E.E. and 9-10
years as S.E.

Thus engineers could aspire to head power

stations (in the rank of A.C.E.) only when they were on
the verge of retirement.

The Committee therefore recomm-

ends that GEE so re-orient its promotion policy - if necessary by adopting a 'fast track' approach whereby a fixed proportion of engineers at D.E. level could be selected, trained andthoreafter given accelerated promotions
so as to make them A.C.Es after about 20 years of total
service.

Those engineors who do not enter this 'fast

track' should also be assured 8f a career upto the level
of 5.E.
