Analysis of

4.1.1

Power Stations are complex systems and it is diffioult to
pinpoint exactly the causes of problems as usually a number
of interrelated factors play their part.

As the following

table shows, there are a number of reasons for unscheduled
outages.

Most of the outages are accounted for by the problems in
boilers.

The forced outages in turbo-generators have been

fewer but have been of much longer duration.
4.1.2

A E Co. has submitted a list of forced outages yearwise

since commissioning.

This is at Appendix

It is

noticed that most outages are of short duration and
the overall availability of the set does not vary very
much from year to year.
