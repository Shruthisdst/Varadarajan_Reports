The Committee recommends that the State Government should
ensure that adequate financiul provision is made to enable
the Board to place orders for spare parts with long

deli~

very schedules. (6.6,4)

Outlook for the future
The projections of peak demand for the next ten years and
the installed capacity required to meet it are shown in
graph on page

'9 . . The

not additions to installed capa-

city planned during the same period are also shown.
It is apparent that even if all projects are completed
as schedulod, the installed capacity in the Gujarat System
will be able to cater to the lowest (11th Annual Power
Survey) projection of peak demand only after 1988. Considering the likely delays in commissioning/sanction of
new projects,

it appears inevitable that some load

restrictions will have to continue in Gujarat for the
foreseeable future.

7.7.3

The immediate objective therefore should be to ensure a
stable power supply so that load restrictions do not have
to be changed from day to day.
This objective can be achieved only if forced outages
are brought down, though the problems associated with
fluctuations in peak demand on account of the nature
of agricultural operations would largely remain.
The recommendations of this Committee have been made
with the objective primarily of reducing forced outages
