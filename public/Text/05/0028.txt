Detailed planning of the maintenance work should be
taken up far in advance of the actu31 scheduled unit
shut-down. 4.37(4)

The maintenance work is planned in advance. However, a list
of spare parts required or likely to be required was not
available. Consequently eome spare parts have to be

purch~

ased after the unit is opened. It is preferable to plan
for availability of spare parts even though they may not be
required for each overhaul. It is suggested that a list of
spare parts consumed during each overhaul be maintained
and compiled to predict the spare parts requirements for
the future. G.E.B. may also take steps to share this information with other stations in the country on a reciprocal
basis.
e.

All the activities should be carefully assessed and
put in the form of a PERT Chart to be able to plan and
control the activities properly_ 4.37(5)

This is done.

f.

The
the
day
not

work must be organised ih two full shifts using
third shift for preparatory work for the ensuing
and for completion of routine work, which dOGS
require much skill. 4.37(6)

Two shifts are used. Some preparatory work is at times
carried out in the third shift.
g.

A group of a minimum of 4 engineers including the leader
of the team and one engineer for the boiler, one for
the turbine and one for the electrical and instrumentation should be exclusive~y put on the planning and eXBcution of maintenance works. 4.37(7)

No man power is allocated exclusively for planning and
execution of maintenance work.
h.

AdvancG action should be taken to assess and procure
spare parts, manpower and materials required for maintenance sufficiently in advance, so that they are
011 available at site before the unit is taken down
for maintenance. 4.37(8)
