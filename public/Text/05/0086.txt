6.6.4

The Committee as a result of its discussions with the
Member (Finance), finds that cash provision for spare
parts needs to be increased.

The finance for spare pa-

rts are provided on the basis of actual consumption of
spare parts.

However, because of long lead times,

in-

crease in prices, and the need for partial advance payment to suppliers, the requirements for working capital
has increased considerably.

The Committee recommends

that the State Government ensure that adequate provision
on this account is made in GEEts budget.
