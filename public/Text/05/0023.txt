Instrumentation was usually completed within periods ranging from 6 months to 2

~ears

from the date of commissioning.

However as mentioned later, many of the instruments and
controls are not working at all or are unreliable even
today.

The commissioning problems accounted for a much lower level
of generation during the first year of operation of the
sets. Both Ukai and Gandhinagar reported availability factors of 52 and 54 per cent respectively during the first
year. A.E. Cots 'Dr Station had an A.F. of only 22% in

any of the stations. As many of the instruments are not
reliable, some of the data on operating conditions is inaccurate. While recommendations for improving instrumentation are made elsewhere (Ch. IV), it is suggested that one
