Drum Internals of 120MW Ukai units 1&2:

The drum

internals of 120MW units of Uka! boilers are not properly designed and therefore heavy carry-over is taking place.
This has resulted in failure of 2 HP Rotors.

This point

was taken up with BHEl from the very beginning.

Recently

they had agreed to modify the design and also to provide
secondary scrubbers and accordingly the work has been
oompleted in Ukai Unit II.

The effectiveness of the

modified design will only be known after recommissioning
of Unit II at Ukai.

It may be mentioned here that GEB

has no carry-over problem in 200MW units at Ukai and
also in

120~

units at Gandhinagar, where the operating

staff and also quality of water chemistry is identical.
3.!.3

trequent trouble of Primary Air Fan in 200MW units:
Heavy vibrations are experienced in Primarv Air Fans of

2GJMW units at Ukai.

Earlier GE9

use~

to repair them

by some patch work at site on rE~ommendations of 8HEL.

Last year some modifications were carried out for which
impellers were sent to Trichy Workshop of BHEL.

Even

after modification, the performance has not improved.
Now they have suggested further modification stating
that they willbe supplying a hybrid design ror the
impeller.

Thus, trial and error methods are used by

BHEL instead of supplying proven design.

GEB is doubtÂ·

ful about the performance even of the proposed
hybrid design.
