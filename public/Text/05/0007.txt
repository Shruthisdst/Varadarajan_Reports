~nteraction

with G.E.B.

The question of better interaction with GEB to ensure
that in the projects under execution and also in future
projects, cordial relationship between GEB and BHEL exists
was discussed in detail.
BHEL stands by its commitment to render the best of
service to the customers and it shall do the best that is
possible to ensure that proper interaction is restored
between BHEL and GEB.
To restore confidence of GEB in our equipment and
services, it was suggested by us that a complete project
may be handed over to us on turn-key basis with stipulation of penalty and aoceptance as was done in the case of
Tripoli and BHEL could prove its ca~ability in such a project.

the same purpose and he along with Shri B.K. Patel, Chief
Engineer, GEB will go over the technical points and suggest solutions.
