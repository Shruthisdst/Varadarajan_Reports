Committee Observations

The growth of BHEl has been so rapid that an adequate
number of experienced personnel may not have been
available to evaluate changes in design and in materials
used and to resolve problems once a unit starts
operations.

Inadequate competitive pressure has also

resulted in deterioration in the after sales service.
8HEL does not have the organisation to adequately
monitor the results of changes in design or in manufacturing processes or in materials used.

Comprehensive

manuals for operations or maintenance are not provided
to the customers.

Proper drawings and instructions for

maintenance of equipment some times are not available.
Pressure for early commiSsioning of sets results in
inadequate testing and instrumentation at the time
commissioning.

There is no system of guaranteed

performance test of the power generating sets
