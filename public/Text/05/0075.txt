Further expansion in the numbers of

stations would therefore overburden the Head Office.

The proposed organisation structure for the station is
exhibited on Chart No.

6.2.4

I.

To permit power stations to become self sufficient in
man8ging themselves, the non-technical functions of accounting, personnel and materials management need to be
upgraded.

There should be one person each of a level

equivalent to S.E. respomsible for these functions reporting to the chief of the station.

These persons will

receive functional guidance from their corresponding
counterparts at the head office.

A separate technolo-

gical services group needs to be established.

A small

staff group is needed for daily monitoring of operations
and planning for generation of power.

The tasks invol-

ved in managing the town-ship and community relations
noed to be separated from those of operating the generating station.

These could be placed under an Admini-

strative officer of the level of E.E.
