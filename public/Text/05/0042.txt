The Co~rnittee recommends the setting up of a formal
consultative machinery comprising senior representatives of the various concerned agencies viz. the
manufacturers, consultants/designers and the users
to ensure that the experience gained from the units
in operation is regularly fed back and incorporated
into the design and manufacture of the new units.
Such a consultative machinery should function
preferably under the Chairmanship of Member(Thermal)
of CEA. ,4.28
fhe long felt demand that manufacturers should
provide comprehensive instruction manuals for erection, operation and maintenance to the station staff
should be met expeditiously. These should be
.
prepared for different levels of operating staff so
that operators and mechanics, supervisors, junior
and senior officers are clear about what functions
they are expected to perform. 4.29
The Committee would like to emphasise that manufacturers must give the highest priority to the manufacture of spares and even let the regular output
be curtailed if necessary. The C~~ should, through
its operations wing, ensure ~l1at SE8s place orders
sufficiently in advance for them to be built into
the manufacturer's productioll programme and should
monitor their production. 4.50
