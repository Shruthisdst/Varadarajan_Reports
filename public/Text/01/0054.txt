ANNEXURE 2.1

Gas liquid chromatography (G LC)

The first ten compounds of the tank residue listed under 2.2 â€¢.5
were estimated by G LC.

Various columns were investigated for separation

and quantitative estimation. The following three columns were found suitable
for the separation of first seven compounds and their quantitative estimation.
The procedure used fOr determination of amines is described separately.

1.

FFAP - J - 1096

2.

OV-210 + OV-17 - 3-596

3.

Carbowax 20 M TPA - .5-796

Variation in the load of the phase helps in eluting all the components in shorter time.
Determination of MICT, OMI, Dione and Ureas
Sample preparation:
About 3g of the sample was weighed in a 100 ml beaker and'
repeatedly extracted with acetonecontaining 296 dimethylamine. The extraction
was repeated four times with 15 ml portions of the acetone containing
dimethylamine.

Dimethylamine ensures the dissolution of aU the organic

compounds excepting the tarry compounds in the sample.
were made up to 100 ml and the solution (0.4
GLC.

The extracts

pO was injected into the

About 3 to 696 of tarry residue remained undissolved. Only metal

chlorides (0.896) could be identified in the insoluble residue.
were calculated by the reporting integrator.

The results

The accuracy of the results

was checked by injecting known samples into the G LC.
In the case of analysis done using internal standard quantitation,
concentration of internal standard was kept constant for standards as welt
as samples.
The reliability and reproducibility of the methods were checked
by analysing known standard samples.

The results obtained by absolute

calibration curve method are tabulated in Table 2.9.

Reliability test used

for the external standard methods was the determination of standard deviation
for each standard compound.

The results of reliability tests using internal

standard are recorded in the Tabies A-2.3, A-2.4 and A-2.5.
