accumulator, 3600 mm (12 feet) diameter and 6900 mm (23 feet) height.
The capacity of the accumulator is about 80m 3 (21000 gal). The matenal
of construction of VG S is carbon steel.
Gases from RVVH, PVH, MMA Vaporiser SRV and chlorine evaporator SRV are routed to VG S.

The gases get srcubbed in VG S by a counter

current flow of the caustic solution through the packed-bed in the upper
section of VG S.
The accumulator is filled with 10% caustic solution which is
circulated through a cycle cooler to the inlet of the VG S by means of a
circulation pump of about 4500 Ipm, (1200 gpm) capacity.

The strength of

the caustic solution is maintained at 9 to 10% in the accumulator by pumping
in fresh caustic solution of 2096 strength and process water.
The 2096 caustic solution make up capacity is around 95 lpm
(25 gpm).

The gases entering the scrubber, after being scrubbed with the

1096 caustic solution, are either released to the atmosphere through a stack
at a height of approximately 30.5 meters (l00 feet) from the ground or
routed to the flare through a knock-out pot.

The gases coming through

the RVVH and PVH can also be diverted to the fJare directly without passing
through VG S.
It is intended that off-specificatlon liquid MIC from MIC storage
tanks can be disposed off by neutrahsation

the VG S accumulator at a

controlled rate.

1.1 A

Flare tower :

A flare tower has been instaHed primarily to burn vent gases
from the carbon monoxide unit and the MMA vapouriser safety valve discharge.

The flare also burns normal vent gases from the MIC storage tanks,

MRS and VG S.

Vents from the MIC storage tanks can either be routed to

VGS or directly to the flare.

However, the flare tower is not expected

to handle large release of MIC vapours directly.
