Assumptions
i.

The above reactions represent inItIal reactants and final products
without specifying possible intermedIates.

ii.

o

Chloroform present could enter into reactions only above 200 C.
at which stage, all the water present would have been consumed
by reaction with MIC.

Chloroform or its thermal decomposition

pr-oducts could be avaiJable to react with DMU or TMB to produce
the Dione.

iii.

The formation of OMI takes place at high temperatures.

It is

assumed that N-alkylureas are converted to DMf with the simultaneous formation of alkylamines•
.tv.

The gaseous products emitted are assumed to be mainly MIC,
( CH 3Cl ~

car ben dlOX ide, methylchlor ide
(~CI2) and

tetrachloride (CC1 ).

may have been present in very smaH amounts.

v.

methy lene

dichlorIde

Some alkylamlnes

Phosgene (COCI 2 ) and MCC (CH)NHCOCl) present in very smaJJ
amounts are readtJy hydrolysed with water to give hydrogen chloride.
