homogenised.

This sample was prepared by mixing equal quantities from

22 different residue samples.

These samples represent the bottom portions,

middle portions and top portions at different axial positions along the 40
feet long storage tank.

Two such samples were prepared initiaJly, each

of which was divided into 2 portions. These were then cross-mixed to provide
two representative samples.
Total analysis was carried out on this sample and the analytical
results were used to calculate various factors relating to the 'event'.

The

analytical procedures adopted were the same as described earlier. The results
of the analysis are presented in Table 2.9.
The total identified compounds in the sample add up to about
9596.

As indicated earlier, the residue samples contain about 3-696 of un-

identified tarry materials.

2.3.1.

Product distribution :

Besides the presence of various metal and chloride ions, the
residue contains 10 organic compounds.
in the last column of Table 2.9.

These are presented as kg moles

The tank residue contains 40.7 kg moles

(or about 7000 kg of MIC trimer).

The nex t highest molar concentration

is that of OMI with 17.0 kg moles (2675 kg ~ followed by the chloride ions
with a concentration of 15.2 kg moles (540 kg). All the amines taken together
add up to 16.9 kg moles in the residue (800 kg).

In all, a total of 97 kg

moles of compounds are present in the residu'e, accounting for about 12
tonnes out of the 12.5 tonnes of the residue estimated to be present.
