Disposal of MIC

Since the possibility oj the material in tank 611, undergoing
reaction was noted, there were suggestions, the material should be disposed
off through reaction with alpha-naphthol and the processing should be
started from 7th December, 1984. This was not accepted by Dr. Varadarajan
on the following grounds:
i.

There was reason to believe the reactions in tank

610 occured due to ingress of some material, possibly small

amounts of water and metallic contaminants.
H.

There were common header lines for the three tanks

and 'they may contain water or metal contaminants. Use of
may
..
these in some wayLmtroduce
contammants
Into tank 611 an d
thereby start a violent reattions similar to those in tank 610.
It was necessary to examine all potential sources for ingress
of material and eliminate them before taking actions to transfer
MIC from tank 611 for processing.

Use of untested nitrogen

without precautions might lead to such reactions.
iii.

The material in tank 611 had been processed upto

2nd December, 1984 for conversion to Sevin and the quality
of the material had been considered satisfactory.

There was

no indication of instability in tank 611 up to 7th December,
1984.
iv..

Since the possibility of reaction occuring in tank

611 existed, all steps have to be taken to ensure minimum
damage as outlined earlier.

Therefore, these steps had to

be given priority and had to be completed before attempts

to dispose off MIC in tank 611.

These included operation

of VG S, mobilisation of additi0nal alkali supplies, erection
of water curtains around the top gas outlet and around the
factory perimeter, evacuation of people around the factory
and those in open structures, education of the public on precautions and establishment of communication
