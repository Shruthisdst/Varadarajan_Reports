Procedure
About 0â€¢.5 to 1 g of a sample waS' accurately weighed using
a Sartorius Balance.

The weighed sample was transferred into a 250 ml

beaker and diluted to about 80 ml with distilJed water.

The solution was

made acidic by adding .5 ml of h3 dilute nitric acid. the chloride ion selective
electrode and the reference electrode (O/J reference electrode with sodium
nitrate in the outer compartment) were introduced into the solution and
kept on the magnetic stirrer.

A Teflon coated magnetic needle was used

as the stirring bar. The electrodes were connected to the automatic titrator.
The end point of the titrator was set at + 300 mV.

Before starting the

titration, the solution was stirred- weJl to ensure that all the chlorides are
dissolved in the solution. The stirring was continued throughout the titration.
The burette addition automatically stopped when the potential reached
+

300 m V.

The volume of silver nitrate solution added was noted down

after the titration was over.
The chloride content in the sample was calculated by using
the equation
