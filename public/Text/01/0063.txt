Determination of Chlorides by Potentiometric Titration
Chloride content (CI-) was determined by tItrating against standard
silver nitrate solution potentiometrically.

Residue samples from tank 610

as we-ll as other samples were determined by this procedure. All the samples
after diluting with water were made acidic with dilute nitric acid before
titration.
Reagents and Appratus

AR

1.

Grade reagents were used for all the ·work.

0.1 N silver nitrate was prepared by dissolving 85 g of silver
nitrate in .5 litres of deionised-distilled water.

The solution

was standardised using sodium chloride as standard.

2.

Mettler autofnatic titrator was used for all the titrations. ORION
CHLORIDE ion selective electrode along with a double junction
reference electrode was used as the indicator electrode system.
A magnetic stirrer was used tor stirring the solutions during

titrations.

The end point of the titration wa-s determined by plotting m V

against volume of standard AgNO) added.
