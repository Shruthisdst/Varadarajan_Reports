The acid present in the samples and the chloride were determined by potentiometric titration.
Metallic ions as iron, chromium, nickel, calcium and magnesium
were determined by atomic absorption and sodium by flame photometry.
Moisture contents in the samples were determined by Karl-Fischer
titration.
Accuracy

and

reproducibility of analysis were established by

using standard mixtures prepared from pure compounds.
Analytical Results:
The foHowing compounds were identified in the residue samples
taken from va~ious locations in tank 610.

The chemical structures of the

first seven compounds are given in Figure 2.3.

'Total representative' sample of residue and its analysis :
A total representative sample was prepared by mixing samples

drawn from the various windows of the tank.
