CHEMISTRY OF FORMATION OF COMPOUNDS IN TANK 610:

Having

established

the

presence of the compounds described

in Section 2 and listed in 2.2.5 in the residue in tank 610, it was desirable
to find conditions and circumstances leading to the
chemical entity.

formation of each

It also became necessary to gain some understanding of

the complex chemistry of the reactions that occurred and the various plausible
routes by which the products found could have been formed.

Experiments:
Since simulation of the exact conditions of the total event that

occurred in tank 610 was not possible, experiments were carried out by
taking small quantities of MIC and subjecting them to different reaction
conditions.

The MIC used for these experiments was from material coHected

from tank 611 from the Bhopal plant.

Its composition is given in Table

2.2. It contained CHel and hydrolysable chlorides.

Two sets of experiments were carried out:
a)

In the first set, a few experiments were done with MIC
which was taken in loosely stoppered pyrex tubes essentially
at atmospheric pressure, and reacted with different reagents.

b)

In the second set of reactions, MIC and/or its derivatives,
with or without reagents, was taken in stainless

steel

containers, sealed and heated to and maintained at different
temperatures

for

predetermined

times.

After

cooling,

the seal was broken and the residue was examined. Gaseous
products have not been examined in these experiments.
Further work will be done to identify and estimate the
gaseous products as well.
Summaries of a few representative experiments are given in
Table 3.1.

Experimental procedures along with details of laboratory experi-

ments (Table A-l.l) are given in Annexure 3.1.
