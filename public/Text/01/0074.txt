ANNEXURE 3.1

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE:
a)

The reactions at atmospheric pressure and room temperature
were carried out either in a pyrex or stainless steel tube with
a Joosely fitting cork through which a thermometer was fixed
to observe the temperature of the reaction. The rise in temperature
due to the exothermic reaction was noted.

In the reaction, wherein

a trace of iron catalyst was added (Expt. No. 17 of Table A-J.I

~

after an induction period of about I hr a vigorous trimenzatlon
0

reaction set in. T he temperature rapidly rose to 40-45 C, and
MIC boiled off through the loosely fitting cork.
b)

The reactions were carried out in closed stainless steel bombs
at specifled temperatures and predetermined times as glven in
Table A-3.1. The bombs were cooled to OOC

or

less

and

the

product extracted, first with acetone and then with water.

The

residue from the acetone ex tract was subjected to direct G LC
analysis.

Both an OV-210 plus OV-17 on a chromosorb column,

which shows tetramethylbiuret (TRMB) as a clear separate peak,
and FFAP on a chromosorb column, were used for analysis. Details
of analytical instrumental conditions and methods of standardisation
and peak matching are given in Annexure 2.
The values in parentheses reported in column 7 of Table A-J.I
represent

the

approximate

percentages

of

these

components

present in the total acetone extract for the particular experiments.
