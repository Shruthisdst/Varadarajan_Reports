Trimerisation of MIC to solid material in small quantities
and consequent choking of lines leading to tank was a frequent
occurence and seems to have been well accepted by the plant
operating staff.

Similarly, cleaning and purging with water of

lines associated with the storage tanks was also accepted
as a routine procedure.

The hazards presented by ingress

of water or other contaminants which could cause trimerisation and lead to choking was not appreciated and the tank
610 was allowed to stay without positive nitrogen pressure
from 22nd October to 2nd December, 1984.
The

uec

brochure on MIC makes reference to the reaction

of water to produce DMU and TMB.

The heat generated

would be related to the quantity of water.

The brochure

also mentions metallic contaminants could lead to violent
reactions of MIC which has the unique combination of properties of explosive
reactivity, ready volatility and high
inhalation toxicity.
It seems possible that small amounts
of water in presence of trace amounts of metallic contaminants could set off explosive reactions and leakage not containable in the inadequate VG S system.
It was entirely unnecessary to provide facilities for storage
of such large amount of MIC in tanks.

The quantities stored

were quite disproportionate to the capacity of further conversion
of MIC in downstream unit.

This permitted MIC to be stored

witho~t

appreciation of potential hazards.

for months together

The events on 2nd/3rd December, 1984 arose primarily from
these facilities and accepted practices.
The

rapid rise in temperature and violent reactions that

occured necessitate the onset of metal ion catalysed polymerisation.

The presence of chloroform has no influence

whatsoever in initiating or accelerating the run-away reactions.
The chloroform present was involved in chemical transformations when the temperature had risen above 200Â°C at
which stage all the water would have already been consumed
by reactions.
