Operators of Union

Carbide and of Nitrogen Factory had to be located and brought
back to function and given instruction and training to work

appreciation of aU actions to be taken under different circumstances that may emerge.
Based on these, it was decided not to embark on processing

such operations to a later date, after aU reViews, modifications and arrangements had been completed.

A H concerned, after fuU discussions, agreed

with this approach.
For purposes of reaction 'of MIC with alpha-naphthol, a complete
detailed system of organisation and review was established. Samples of
alpha-naphthol and solvents were

checked and detailed written procedures were i5sued. Wireless communication
systems were established for constant contact with control ceUs in the
Factory and at the State Secretariat. Special communication tele- links
and hot-lines with Delhi and other centres enabled the mobilisation of
materials, equipment, personnel. A number of senior scientists and technologists from

research organisations and major chemical manufacturing
