It is conceivable that gaseous MIC would be emitted due
to a rapid reaction inside the tank.

This gas is expected

to be neutralised by circulating alkali solution in the packed
section of VGs.

This system is also grossly inadequate

the event.

Calculations show that even

if the normal design load for VGS is taken into consideration, the VGS is inadequate to neutralise a discharge of
28 tonnes of vapourised MIC in about 2 hours.

on the night of December 2, 1984.
The relief val ve design could not permit free flow of large
quanti ties of gases, certainly at the level at which they
were generated during the event.

Thus, the tank contents

were subjected to pressures much higher than 40 psig and
correspondingly high temperatures.
From the examination of the tank residue and from the
