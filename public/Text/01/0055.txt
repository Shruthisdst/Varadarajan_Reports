All the values obtained by using different methods are within
the acceptable range for G LC analysis.

Standard solutions :
The standard solution of each compound was prepared by using

purified compounds, with a concentration to match the quantity of that
compound actually present in the samples.

All the standard compounds

(synthesised or isolated) were characterised by their spectral data.
was used as a solvent for preparing the solutions.

Acetone

Standard solutions of

various concentrations of each compound were prepared to match the peaks
of the sample matrix.
htnments and chromatographic conditions:

The following three instruments were used for the gas chromatographic analysis.
