The fact that the tank 610 was

not under pressure of nitrogen for approximately two
months prior to the accident also indicates that conditions
ex isted for entry of contaminants such as metallic impurities through the high pressure nitrogen line.

As empha-

have a

catalytic

effect on the possible reactions MIC can undergo.
The hydrolysis of MIC with about 500 kg. (1100 lb) of
water by itself and in the absence of other contaminants
is not expected to lead to thermal run-away conditions.
The presence of this quantity of water would have possibly
resulted in reaction with about three to four tonnes
of MIC, generation of carbon dioxide, breaking of the
rupture disc and release of CO • The temperature of

the tank content would have graduql1y risen to about
60-70°C, below the boiling point of MIC at that pressure.
It is surmised that no more than 50 to 100 kg/hr (110220 lb/hr) of CO

along with small quantities of MIC,

ca 100-150 kg/hr (220 - 330 lb/hr) would have been
released. Such emissions wiH cease once the water has been
consumed.
The presence of trace amount of metallic contaminants
derived from the material of the tank or its attachments
or from ex traneous sources, may not necessarily initiate
a violent reaction under dry conditions.

Small amounts

of local trimerisation may take place, as noticed throughout
the pipelines and plant.

However, the ingress of water,

would provide for active species of initiator to be generated
and distributed in the liquid.
This implies that conditions which were ripe for the
initiation of a run-away trimerisation reaction already
existed in tank 610 on the day of the event; and that
entry

would generate active
