AN ANALYSIS OF THE EVENT:

The background and circumstances, the study of the properties of the materials, examination of tank residue, experiments on conditions for formation of various chemical entities, critical examination
of relevant features of design have all been described in the previous
chapters. This provides a basis for outlining factors which led to the
event, which are given in the following paragraphs:
MIC readily undergoes chemical reactions with explosive
violence, which produce a large amount of heat, and allow
a

large portion of stored liquid MIC to vapourise. This

is inherent to the nature of the material. Neither the precise
conditions under which such run-away reactions could be
initiated in MIC nor its manner of prevention are well
known.
-

A large quantity of MIC was st{)red in underground tanks
which have many inlets and outlets that can permit
entry

of

contaminants

which

can

trigger

off

explosive

reactions.
The studies described earlier indicate that a reaction was

initiated and the

temperature

rose rapidly.

There

was

no 'rate of rise in temperature' alarm to indicate the rising
temperature

which

would

have

alerted

the operator

to

an early detection of a run-away reaction.
Any emergency dumping of liquid MIC into t'1e VGS would

not have been feasible because the alkali available in the
accumulator

is grossly insufficient.

Furlher more,

this

would also lead to an abnormal temperature rise in the
VGs.
