1,1,3,5 - Tetramethylbiuret
A ttempts to prepare tetramethyl biuret by heating trimethylurea with ex cess MIC in a s.s. bomb at 100°C resulted in a mix ture of
compounds.

The resulting products were analysed by G C and MS and the

presence of unreacted trimethyl urea, traces of MIC trimer, tetramethyl
biuret and trimethy I biuret were confirmed.
Dione
Dione was prepared by condensation of methylal with 1,3,5trimethyl biuret in sulfuric acid.

The purity was confirmed by M.P. and

spectral data.
MIC Trimer

MIC trimer was isolated from the tank residue and charac-

terised by spectral data.

The chloroform layer was evaporated. The residue was collected

in a stoppered long tube.

The tube containing the residue was introduced

in an oil bath and heated to about 150°C. The sublimate at the colder portions
of the tube was collect4d and characterised by IR, NMR and M.S.

The crystals formed on cooling were filtered off and

recrystallised from toluene and characterised by IR, NMR and MS.
