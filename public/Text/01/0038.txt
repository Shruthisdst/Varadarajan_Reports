section was mechanically forced inside the residue tiB it reached the bottom
of the tank.

The residue entering the pipe was pushed out by using a closely

fitting pusher rod inside the pipe.

The sampJes thus pushed out of the pipe

section formed a cylindrical semi-solid mass.

Each sample was

divided

longitudinally into 4 portions with the bottom materiaL in contact with the
vessel wall receiving identification number 1 of the respective series. Similarly,
alphabets A to E were used for identifying the sampJes from different nozzles
(see Figure 2.1).
2.1.2.

Samples from tank residue after opening the tank :

Samples from various locations inside the tank were collected
after cutting windows on the body of the tank.

Various sampling points

I

and windows on the body are presented in FIgure 2.2. After cutting windows
on the body of the tank, the inside of the tank was photographed.

One of

the important observations made during the opening of the windows was
a very strong smeH of amines.

Four sets of samples were taken from each

window. Samples were collected using a .5 cm dia. stainless steel pipe section
and divided into 4 equat parts as described in 2.1.1. Each sample was properly
marked and coded.

For example, a sample marked 8-H-l represents the

bottom cross-section of the residue from window

'c'

collected on 8th April.

The time and date of sampling were also marked on the sample bottle tags.
The tank residue was fO\Jnd to be about .52 cm deep.
2.1.3.

Samples from pipelines:
Liquid samples were collected from

1985 and May, 198.5.

RVVH/PVH in February,

Description of these samples along with their analyses

is given in Table 2.1.

MIC samples from tank 611 :

MIC was stored in 3 stcrage tai<s it the Union Carbide factory. The
tanks are designated E-610, E-611 and E-619. During the night of December
2-3, 1984, the mishap occurred in tank E-610. Tank 611 still contained large
quantities of MIC.
