MIC and its Characteristics :

MIC is a highly reactive, toxic, volatile and inflarnmable chemical.
According to the UCC brochure, MIC is usually stored and handled in stainless
steel 304 and 316 equipment.

Iron or steel, aJiminaum, zinc or galvanized

iron, tin, copper or their aHoys are prohibited from use.
Purified MIC will react with itself under the influence of a catalyst
to form a cyclic trimer or a high molecular weight polymer.

Strong bases

such as sodium hydroxide, sodium methoxide and sodium acetate, certain
metal chlorides such as ferric chloride and stannic chloride catalyse trimerisat ion.

Since the reaction is quite exothermic, contamination of MIC with

traces of the catalysts can cause violent reactions.
Highly purified MIC wiH polymerise spontaneously to a linear
polymer /trimer.
Water reacts exothermicaUy to produce heat and carbon diox Ide.
As a result, the tank pressure will rise rapidly if MIC is contaminated with
water.

The reactia1 may begin slowly, especially if there is no agitation,

but it will become violent.

Aqueous sodium hydroxide solution will react

with MIC quite rapidly.
MIC with the above mentioned characteristics should be considered

as an explosive in addition to it being a highly toxic chemical.
As per the UCC brochure, the storage temperature should be

0

maintained below 15 C and preferably at about

aOc.

The storage tank is

to be equipped with dual temperature indicators that will sound an alarm
and flash warning lights if the temperature Qf the stored material rises
abnormally.

The tendency of valves on storage tanks to be clogged with

solids is also stated in the brochure.
The brochure further states that the cooling medium in the heat
exchanger should not be one that reacts with MIC or catalyses the reactions.
While chloroform is an example of a safe coolant, use of water does create

a hazard.
