Qua"ltitation method - internal standard
Several compounds were tried as internal standards, out of which
dibutyl phthalate was selected since its retention time did not interfere
with any other component of the sample matrix.
Standard solutions with internal standard:

Standard solutions of all the compounds with equal amounts
of internal standard were
solutions had a wide range.

prepared.

Concentrations of these standard

This was necessary for area matching as in

the case of ex ternal standard.
Retention time data and order of elution :
Retention times and elution data for all the compounds on all
the columns are given in Tables A-2.1 and A-2.2.
chromatograms are attached in Figures A.I and A.2.
