perusal of the reports of the events of the night of 2/3 December, 1984,
it appears during the clep.ning of choked filters with water in the Relief
Valve Vent Header, such water, perhaps mixed with alkali from Vent Gas
Scrubber Accumulator, could have entered the non pressurised tcthk and
may have carried some metallic contaminants from the carbon steel portions
of header pipelines.

chloroform has no influence whatsoever in initiating or

accelerating the run-away reactions.

The quantum of leakage is related

not to the quantum of water but to the amount of MIC stored in a single
container.

If 42 tonnes of MIC had been stored in 210 stainless steel drums

instead of a single tank, leakage by reactions or spillage would be no more
than one fifth of a tonne.
Public preparedness for eventualities are dependent on information
available on the toxicity and hazards.

It appears that the factors that

led to the toxic gas leakage and its heavy toll existed in the unique combination of properties of MIC and from the features of design of the plant.
Storage of large quantities of such a material for unnecessarily long periods
in single large tanks was made possible by the facilities installed. Insufficient
caution in design, in choice of materials of construction and in instrUJnents,
together with lack of facilities for safe effective quick disposal of materials
showing instability contributed to the event and to the adoption of guidelines
and practices in operation and maintenance.

The combination of conditions
Some inputs of integrated

scientific analysis of the chemistry, design and controls relevant to the
manufacture would have avoided or lessened considerably the extent of
damage.
