had been transferred from tank 610 to tank 611..

It was aJso noted that many

pipeline systems for input into the three tanks and output from these were
connected to common headers.

It was reahsed that the MIC in tank 611

could also lead at any time to a further release of toxic gases and therefore
presented a serious potential hazard to large population, remalnJng factory
staff, visitors, officials m the vicinity and to personnel providIng relief and
medical

attentIon.

They were not aware of thIS further hazard and they

had no knowledge of the precautions to be observed in the event of another
toxic gas leakage.

The crisis warranted immedIate measures and a new

crisis management system, for the following:
Estimating the probability of a further leakage.
Analysis of circumstances that led to the leakage

on

2/3 December, 1984.
Devising means to prevent,

jf

possible, a leakage from

tank 611.
In the event of leakage occuring, precautions to be taken
for minimising the damage to those present 10
the factory and to the public outside through
various measures, including large scale evacuation
of the population.
Safe disposal of the material in tank 611.
OJtiining of precautions to be observed within the factory
and in the vicinity of the factory to neutralise
any toxic gaseous materiaJ that might be emitted.
Provision of information to the Government authorities
on steps to be taken to minimise effects of such
potentlal tox.ic gases.
Provision of information on precautions to be observed
by the public

10

the event of any gas leakage

and quick dJssemination of warning, it an imminent
