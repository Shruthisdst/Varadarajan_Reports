Determination of eamines
Various columns were investigated for the separation and quantitative analysis of amines by G LC. The column described below was developed
and was found to be suitable for the quantitative estimation of amines.
(Fig A-3).
Sample Preparation
About I &

of the sample was

injected in the G as Chromatograph.

extract~d

with 50 ml water and

The percen ldges of amines were calcu-

lated directly.
Standard Solutions
Standard mix ture, containing MMA, OMA and T MA were prepared
from the corresponding standard solutions of amines.

Standard solutions

(0 •.5 ,...1) were injected into the Gas Chromatograph. The 10 Table was prepared
and filed.

The reliability of the method was checked by injecting known

concentration of the amines in the Gas Chromatograph.
Retention times of amines were as follows:

3.8.5 min

Monomethylamine
Dimethlamine

.5.29 min

Trimethylamine

5.99 min
