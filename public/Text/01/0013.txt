MIC manufacturing pt"'ocess
The raw materials used to make MIC are monomethylamine (MMA )

and phosgene.

Chloroform is used as solvent in the MIC process, and caustic

Jye for the neutralisation of any toxic material requiring disposaJ.

Phosgene is produced by reacting carbon monoxide and chlorme.
Carbon monoxide is produced by reaction (1)f petroleum coke with oxygen.
Petroleum coke is obtained from an indigenous suppHer, and ox ygen is suppJied
from a neighbouring air separation plant.

Chlorine, MMA, caustIc Jye and

chloroform are brought in by tankers and stored in tanks.

Facili ties for

storage of carbon monoxide and phosgene, both of which are highly toxic
gases, were not provided. These were utilised for production of MIC as soon
as produced.
MIC is produced by reaction of phosgene and MMA to methyl-

carbamoyl chloride (MCC) and hydrogen chloride (HCI). MCC is then pyrolysed
to yield MIC and HeJ.
The Chemical reactions involved in the production of MIC via
phosgene are as foHows:
