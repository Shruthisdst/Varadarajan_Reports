The Event
Since the accident occurred in the MIC storage tank 610, it

is important to consider information on aspects such as the chemical com
position of the contents of the tank, the history of the material stored and
the observations made by the plant personnel while loading and unloading
the tank prior to the actual event.
A t the start of the production run, i.e. 7th October, 1984, tank

610 contained 6.4 tonnes of MIC, presumably from production lots dating
prior to that time. MIC production run was started on 7th October, and
MIC was being led to tank 610 till 18th October, 1984. An additional 36

tonnes of MIC that was manufactured during that period was also filled
in the same tank. On 18th October, about 23 tonnes of MIC were transferred
to tank 611.

From 19th to 22nd October, all the additional MIC produced

in the plant was fed to and stored in tank 610.

The production of MIC was

stopped on 22nd October and at that time tank 610 contained approximately42 tonnes of MIC.

Tank 611 also contained MIC in quantities of the same

order.
As per the operating practice, MIC in the storage tank was
2
normally kept .under nitrogen pressure of the order of 1 kg/cm g. Reportedly
2
till 21st October, the pressure in tank 610 was maintained at 1.25 kg/cm g.
However, during the night shift (22.45 hours to 06.45 hours) of 21st/22nd
2
October, nitrogen pressure in tank 610 dropped to 0.25 kg/cm g abnormally
and the material in tank 610 continued to be under a low pressure of 0.1
- 0.25 kg/cm 2g from 22nd October onwards. Recording of such low values
is not an indication of any positive nitrogen pressure and denotes the tank
contents were also nearly at atmospheric pressure.
The nitrogen pressure in the MIC storage tank is also utilised
to transfer MIC from the storage tank to the Sevin unit. As

liquid material

is transferred, the gas pressure in the tank wiU show a gradual reduction.
When the pressure in the tank drops to a considerably low value, the rate
of transfer of MIC from the storage tank to the Sevin unit, would become
low. The tank would need to be pressurised again to a higher value

by

admitting high purity nitrogen into the tank.
From 22nd October to 30th November, tank 610 was under nearly
atmospheric pressure. No transfer of liquid MIC for Sevin manufacture took
place from tank 610. During that period MIC was bemg transferred from
tank 611 to the Sevin unit, whenever required.

However, during the 30th

November first shift, there were some problems in the pressurisation system
of tank 611 and the pressure could not be increased. Therefore, attempts
were made to pressurise tank 610 and transfer MIC from that tank to the Sevin Unit,
