i.

MIC reacts with small quantities of water sb.vly at room
temperature, with a half life of 3 to 4 hours.

H.

Addition of a trace of ferric chloride to the above reaction
mixture at room temperature results in a vigorous reaction
after an induction period.

iii.

OM U and T MB are readily formed by reaction of MIC
with water.

iv.

MICT is formed readily from \iIC.

(Presence of MICT

has also been noted in various parts of the plant).

It

can also be formed from TMB by heating. It is very stable
product and is not easily transformed into other products.
v.

The formation of DMI is not noticed below 200 0 C. TMB
alone on heating to temperatutres above 200°C also gives
DMI.

vi.

Di()ne formation was noticed only above 2000 C and the
quantity increases as the temperature is raised.

vii.

P.resence of chlQroform is considered necessary for the
formation of Dione.

viii.

It appears that part of the chloride present has come

from chloroform present in MIC when the reaction temperatures ex ceed 200 0 C.
Ix.

The reaction of MIC with small quantities of water and
chloroform at 250°C gives all the products formed in
tank 610 with the exception of tetramethyl biuret. Formation
of amines and amine hydrochlorides was also noticed.

3.1

Discussion :
Based on the above observations and on the composition of the

residue given in Table 2.7, the following statements can -be made :
Compounds found in the residue can be accounted for by the
reaction of MIC with small quantities of water and chloroform.
