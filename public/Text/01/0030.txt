The reaction with cold water may take time and .less of vapour

This was not therefore proceeded with.

The third proposal was

to feed liquid MIC into aqueous alkali in VG S.

It was noted

chloroform present in MIC would produce dichloro carbenes with
highly obnoxious odour, the spread of which would create considerable panic in the city.

While such a procedure would be inevi-

The

fourth method consisting of conversIon of MIC to Sevin by reaction
with alpha-naphthol was considered suitable, as staU were traIned
in this operation and facihtaes were avculable.

Safeguards agaInSt entry of contaminants
A thorough system review of the plant and associated

facilities was made.

Instruments were rechecked or replaced

to ensure reliability of measurement of temperature and pressure.
Except for certain lines needed for transfer of MIC, others
connected to common header were blinded at the itrst isolation
valve from the tank.

The rupture disc was replaced. An addiuonal

flitration system was introduced In the nitrogen feed hne to
the tank to avoid contaminants belng earned

Checks were
