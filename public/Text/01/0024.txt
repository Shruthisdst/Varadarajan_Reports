cloud was seen to be coming out from the stack by the field operator.
Reportedly, the siren was sounded around 00.30 hours, and the plant personnel
were alerted about the MIC leakage.
From around 01.00 hours, water was sprayed on the MIC structure,
but reportedly, it did not reach the top of the stack from where the gases
were coming out.
Around 03.00 hours, the SRV of tank 610 is reported to have
sat back and the gas also stopped coming out from the stack.
Gas that had escaped into the atmosphere got condensed in
contact with the cold air and due to atmospheric inversion phenomenon,
settled down slowly on the ground. It then evaporated and spread in the
atmosphere gradually due to low wind velocity, thereby affecting the population
greatly.
The escape of such a large quantity of toxic material into
the environment caused all the tragic loss of life, serious damage and disabilities to thousands of people.

A part of the population of Bhopal city

also suffered serious long-term effects which are still being evaluated.
Local authorities, the State Government and the Government
of India and their agencies immediately reacted to this situation and provided
medical relief and other measures.

Medical personnel rushed to Bhopal

from other parts of the country and supplemented the relentless efforts
of local doctors and hospital staff.

Supplies of medicine, food, ox ygen

and equipment were rushed to Bhopal.

Disregarding potential risk and hazard

from tox ic material in the 'area, many volunteered to reach Bhopal and
work there.
Within the Union Carbide Plant itself, everyone moved upwind,
away from the emission and toxic gas flow direction. Only one person was
affected to any ex tent and he recovered. One operator in the neighbouring
oxygen/nitrogen factory unit died and others in the unit have suffered seriously.
