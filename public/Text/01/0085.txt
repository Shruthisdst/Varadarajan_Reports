However, the range of the temperature transmitter provided was only
-25°C to +250 C, with a high alarm setting at +1 JOe.

The contents

of the tank were being stored at ambient temperature, which varies
approximately from +150 C to +40oC at Bhopal. The temperature of
MIC In the storage tanks for most part of the year was higher than
o
the high temperature alarm setting. Le. +ll C. Indeed the temperature
of material In the tank was higher than the maximum of the range
of the temperature transmitter, i.e. +250 C. In such circumstances the
acutal temperature was not known and the transmitter was of no value.
Further, provision of "rate of rise in temperature" alarm would have
Invited the operator's attention to the start of such a reaction.

Refrigeration
There Is only one common compressor and chiller system for

all the three MIC storage tanks. For such a hazardous material as
MIC, where maintaining it at a low temperature is considered very
important, a spare compressor and chiller system would have ensured
proper chiling even when the main compressor and chiller system
is under repairs or maintenance. This provision of spare compressor
and chiller has not been made.

Vent Gas Scrubber
The VGS is designed to neutralise a maximum of about 3.5

tonnes (7700 Ib) of MIC at a maximum rate of about 9.6 tonne/hr
(21200 lb/br) In a vapour form.

The accumulator volume of 80m 3 (21000 gal) If filled with
tlte recommended 10.. caustic solution can neutralise a maximum of
about 13 tonnes of Mle. Also, operation of VGS at temperatures abo.e
70°C for extended periods Is not recommended since absorption will
be poorer and the heat of neutralization is not completly removed by
the cooler In the VGS system.
With the caustic make up pump capacity at 95 Ipm (25 gpm)
of 2D'J& caustic solution, addltional MIC that can be neutralised Is also
limited to about 2 tonnelhr.
