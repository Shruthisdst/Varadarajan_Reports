Oil expLoration

There are numerous instances of total technologies before independence in local raw material
based chemical processes, and isolated cases of
scientific measuring equipment, because of the
demands for consumables.The manufacture of
capital goods other than building materials,
small arms and boats was not widespread. Even
in buildings other than bricks, cement and
structural steel, items such as ceramics, pipes,
valves, sanitary fittings, fans and electrical
components, induding bulbs, were imported.
The exceptions were S L Kirloskar, T V
Sundaram, and PSG Naidu, who introduced
rotating machinery. Ship building continued in
Mazagaon, Surat, and Hubli, although all
instruments, engines and equipment were
imported.
A significant initiative for the growth and
diversification of the chemical industry in
Western India arose from the close association
of Prof KVenkataraman, then Director of the
Bombay University Department of Chemical
Technology, and Dr Pai, a member of the Allied
group of scientists, during the study of records
of the German chemicaL giant Badische Anilin

war in Europe. Details of the technological

Then came the discoveries of very large
petroleum oil and gas reserves in new lncations

Nigeria, Algeria, Mexico, Brazil, VenezuELa and
in the offshore North Sea. Thls changed the
picture regarding energy availability, sbrage,
transport and usage. The Low price inifally
prevailing with oversupply allowed a V-Q-t

coal as a raw material for chemicals ant as a
source for raiL transport, electrical pOWEr generation, and as fuel for heat and cooking. As
solid coal use needs ash disposaL, and the
cleaning of flue gases to meet new stringent
environmental standards, petroleum oil and gas
based technologies made a Significant rreadway.
As oil fluids are of uniform composition. the
economies of scale of production in chemicals
and energy have radically altered. Batch
processes are replaced by continuous processes.
The potential role of petroleum, was rerognised
in India by the then Oil Minister K 0 Mataviya.
