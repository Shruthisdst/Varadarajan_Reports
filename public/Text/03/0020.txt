month barely exceed 3. This
allows a large gap in
rainfall events and subsequently a large accumulation of
pollutant species in the atmosphere before wash- out.
Dry depostion of poll utants is expected to increase
during the rainfall gap periods.

AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STATUS IN THE AGRA-MATHURA REGION
A. TAJMAHAL
55.
As the Taj Mahal is the focal sensitive receptor,
the
ambient air quality monitoring (AAQM) was started
within Taj
Mahal premises in January; 1981 by NEERI,
Nagpur. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) took over
the monitoring activities of Taj Mahal from NEERI during
April, 1986. The
monitoring
at the Taj Mahal was
continued by CPCB till August,
1988, and on the 15th
September, 1988, the station was handed over to the U. P.
Pollution Control Board which is operating the
air
quali ty monitoring station till date. Sulphur dioxide
,NO and suspended
particulate matter (SPM) are the
pollution parameters which are
being monitored at the
AAQM Station at the Taj Mahal, Agra.
56.
The trend analysis of various pollutants
monitored at the Taj Mahal during 1981-1993 reveals the
following:
Sulphur dioxide (Period 1981-1985)

i.

The annual mean concentration of Sulphur dioxide
was recorded as 15. 4
micrograms/ cubic metre in
1981 which came down to 8.2 micrograms/ cubic metre
in 1982, probably due to closing down of two coal
based thermal power stations in Agra in 1981 and
dieselisation of the Agra Fort Marshalling Yard.

ii.

The annual average Sulphur dioxide concentrations
for 1982-1985 at Taj Mahal work out to less than
13 micrograms/ cubic metre with individual annual
mean
concentrations
ranging
between
8.2
micrograms/ cubic metre (Year 1982) and 18.1
micrograms/ cubic metre (Year 1984)

iii. The monthly mean values are generally less than 20
micrograms/ cubic metre
wi th some winter month
values crossing 30 micrograms/ cubic metre in 1984
and 1985.
