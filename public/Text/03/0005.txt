REVIRW OF TAJ TRAPEZ IUf-l
6.
There had been requests that the restrictions
imposed
on expansion of existing industries and
development of new ones within the Taj Trapezlum Zone
should be reviewed.
NEERI was
commissioned by the
Ministry of Environment and Forests in January 1993 to
carry out studies.
A Report entitled "Air
pollution
Studies to Redefine Taj Trapezium Coordinates" was
submitted in July 1993.

STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES FOR EMISSIONS AND AIR QUALITY

7.
The studies carried out by the Expert Committee
in 1974-77 on the impact of Mathura Refinery were among
the earliest
internationally on impacts from proposed
new industries.
In the ensuing period, world concern
for the environment has markedl y
increased, and new
standards and guidelines based on needs of human health,
preservation of plant, animal and aquatic life and
indeed all others, including micro-organisms, are being
evolved.
In India the CPCB has also adopted such
standards and guidelines for air quality (Annexure II).
There are three sets of these applicable to different
areas.

8.
The standards and guidelines of WHO as well of
several
developed and developing countries are also
gi ven in Annexure
I I I.
It may be seen the val ues in
standards in India are quite stringent, especially for
sensitive areas
which are cultural
heritage and
wildlife/natural conservancy sites.
In any urban
environment with a high density of population, housing,
commercial establishments, and all forms of hydrocarbon
powered vehicular traffic, it would not be possible to
attain the standards for sensitive areas.
