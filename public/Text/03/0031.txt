82. Shared common high quality furnaces have been
installed in Khurja for pottery producers. This is not
feasible in
Ferozabad glass industry.
It would be
desirable to establish a few demonstration units.
It
would be not be possible to lay natural gas pipelines in
the
existing
industrial
area
due
to
safety
considerations.
Mathura Refinery
83. Detailed discussions have been held at Mathura
Refinery
and with the Chairman and Directors of IOCL
regarding technological improvements to effect further
reductions in
emissions in the short term and medium
term are the outcome of these are described in the next
section on short and medium term plans.

Electric Power Supply
84. It is necessary to obtain substantial changes in the
availability and consumption of energy in the Taj
Trapezium Area
so that improvements in ambient air
quality can be obtained
rapidly and maintained.
Electric power supply can be improved if transformers are
replaced and augmented. The Ministry of Power has been
requested to initiate discussions with the UPSEB, Agra
Development Authority (ADA) and Central Electricity
Authority (CEA) to
find solutions with regard to
transformers so that the position
can be rectified
within 18 months. In addition, Ministry of Power may be
requested to examine the possibility of a dedicated
power generating project with a capacity of 300 MW to
meet the needs of Agra Mathura Region. This could be a
combined cycle gas turbine power generation plant based
on condensates from
associated gas, supplemented by
naphtha.
Such power generation projects have already
been approved in other locations. Such a project can be
located south or south east of Taj Trapezium Zone where
water for steam generation in combined cycle could be
available.
Needs of Agra Region should be met and any
excess can
be fed to the grid.
The Project, if
approved, could be completed wi thin three to four years.
It will help to reduce use of coal and petroleum liqid
products now involved in Taj Trapezium Zone and reduce
atmospheric sulphur and nitrogen oxide levels.
