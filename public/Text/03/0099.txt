ii.

The UNESCO experts, Dr. Mentrizio Marbeilli and Dr.M.Larze
Tabasso felt-that the cracks can be due to various reasons
e.g,

corroded

iron

dowels,

structural

behaviour

of

the

masonry, excess of load, anisotrophy of marble, etc., but
certainly not due to atmospheric pollution.

In their view,

what is urgently needed is to fill the wider cracks and to
replace

the

missing

parts

in

order

to

prevent

water

penetration and further oxidation of iron dowels.

from the

stable and sound.
