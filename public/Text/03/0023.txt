Effect of vehicular pollution is absent at Keetham
as the station is 1.5 km away from NH2. Effect of
brick kilns in Keetham village is observed during
winter months.

Normally high readings are observed during 0600 0900 hrs
and 1800 - 2200 hrs. The monitoring
station is located within the boundary limits of

For

years
considered l the monthly mean concentration ranged
from 3.1 micrograms/ cubic metre in August, 1990 to
12.2 micrograms/ cubic metre
in October and
December, 1993.
58. The trend analysis of ambient air monitoring for
Sulphur dioxide at
these IOC stations suggests that
impact of Mathura Refinery's emissions is felt at Farah
station. The impact of refinery Sulphur dioxide emissions
at Keetham is not predominant as is the case at Farah.
As Sikandra readings have always been
higher than
Keetham readings, it suggests that local sources may be
the cause for high Sulphur dioxide concentrations at
Sikandra.

RECENT AIR QUALITY SURVEY CONDUCTED IN AGRA-MATHURA

REGION
59.
An air quality survey was carried out in MarchI
April, 1995
by MIs. Indian oil Coporation (laC) to
assess the changes, if any, in the air quality status in
comparison to the past air quality data in Agra-Mathura
region.

roc carried out continuous monitoring (reported as
1 hourly avg.) of Sulphur dioxide for a few days at a
stretch during March/ April, 1995 at Farah, Keetham and
Sikandra through their permanent
monitoring stations,
