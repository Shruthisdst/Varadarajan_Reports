i.

The level of SPM at Taj Mahal is generally quite
high, the
monthly mean values being above 200
micrograms/ cubic metre for all the months during
1981-1985 except for the monsoon months.

ii.

There is an increasing trend in the monthly mean
SPM
concentrations from about 380 micrograms/
cubic metre to 620 micrograms/ cubic metre during
the
period 1987-1991, and the trend reverses
thereafter till 1993.
There is a decrease in
monthly mean SPM levels from 620 micrograms/ cubic
metre in 1991 to about 425 micrograms/ cubic metre
in 1993.

B. AMBIENT AIR QUALITY MONITORING FOR Sulphur dioxide IN
MATHURA-AGRA REGION:
57. Mathura Refinery is maintaining a network of three
continuous air quality monitoring stations at Farah,
Keetham and Sikandra beteween Mathura Refinery and Agra.
The trend analysis of Sulphur dioxide data monitored at
these stations by Mathura Refinery during 1990-94 brings
out the following salient features:
a. FARAH (7 km from Mathura Refinery)
i.

The average monthly concentrations of Sulphur
dioxide ranged between 4.0 micrograms/ cubic metre
during March, 1994 to 12.6 micrograms/ cubic metre
during December, 1993.

ii.

The Impact of vehicular emission during the morning
and
evening hours on the ambient air quality is
noticeable. The Farah
monitoring statioin is by
the side of the highway i.e, NH2.

iii. Higher concentrations are noted in winter months as
compared to summer and monsoon months. Night time
readings in winter months are the highest.
h. KEETHAM (25 km from the Refinery>

i.

Keetham readings are generally low I and 4-hourly
and 24- hourly maxima as well as monthly average
readings do not show any significant variations to
establish a trend. Seasonwise and
rnonthwise
variations are not significant.
