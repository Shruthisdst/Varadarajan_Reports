Plans of major consumers and producers of energy in
the
short term of 18 months and medium term of
five years to

rapidly attaining and maintaining high ambient air
quality in the short term, and
effect further
improvements.

ASSISTANCE FROM EXPERTS
15.
The Committee has also endeavoured to obtain views
of recognised experts on the state of monuments, ambient
air quality
predictions, and newer technologies for
quick adoption. In addition the Committee has secured,
through discusssions with
suppliers, producers and
consumers

energy,
time
bound
quantitative
commitments,
wherever
possible,
for
adoption
of
technologies for overall improvement in the sensitive
area within the Taj Trapezium Zone. The Committee has
attempted to consider measures and technologies which,
although calling for change,
will neverthless be
feasible in economic, social and technical terms within
a time frame and will also avoid very large capital
investments and totally novel or unproven systems.

taken note of.
