rOCL have agreed to carry out trials to reduce
emissions of Sulphur dioxide from FCC Unit, currently
contributing about 160 kg/hr through change of catalyst,
and use of addi ti ves.
There are
possibilities of
reduction
of Sulphur dioxide by about 50 kg. /hr by
improvement of the Sulphur Recovery Unit (SRU).
SUPPLY OF CLEANER FUELS
89. The
Commi ttee
has
had
discussions
wi th
Dr. V. L. Kelkar,
Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum and
Natural Gas, with a view to improving further the plans
for supply of cleaner fuels in the Agra-Mathura Region.
The
response from
the
Ministry
in two
recent
communications dated 26 April 1995 and 29 April 1995 from
Shri Nirmal Singh, Joint secretary are placed in Annexure
XIX and xx. The following measures are designed to make
rna jor contributions towards reduction of Sulphur dioxide
levels in the Taj Trapezium Zone:
April 1996 •
September 1996
March 1996 •

HSD with 0.25% Sulphur

to

upto January 1995

90.
Thus, HSDwith 0.25% sulphur will be marketed inTaj
Trapezium far ahead of any other location in the country.
This is a major step considering that HSD of 0.25 per
cent sulphur will be marketed in other parts of India
only in the year 2000.
The
Commi ttee is deeply
appreciative of the favourable response from
the
Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas.
Thus, in the
short term of' 18 months I the contributions of Sulphur
dioxide
in the Taj Trapezium
atmosphere,
and
particularly in the vicinity of the Taj Mahal, from
diesel generators and heavy vehicles would be reduced to
one third of present levels. Much freer availability of
LPG to most consumers
and industries from March 1996
will again contribute to reduction of SPM and Sulphur
dioxide from coal and firewood.
If industries in Agra
can be persuaded to use LPG or HSD within this period of
18 months, further improvements in the environment are
possible.
