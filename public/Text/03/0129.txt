Our club established more than a century ago is
afftliated to a large number of cluhs allover India.
The current membership is around one thousand
(1000)
Our members are much concerned about misleadtng
reports in the med·ta that marble. of Taj j{uhal is
1/el1owing.

A large number of our members are born & brought
Jgra & have occasion to see the TaJ at regular
tntervels. This matter was discussed by the me.bers
& ~e have unanimous in our opinion that there is no
ue11owtng. of TaJ Mahal.
