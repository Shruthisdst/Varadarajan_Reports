FACTORS CONCERNING ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY AND
PRESERVATION OF MONUMENTS:

13.
In the appreciation of the Committee, the
ambient alr quality in the Ta] Trapezium, and especially
in the area in
which the major
mouments, namely Taj
Mahal, the Agra Fort,
Itimad ud-Daula, Sikandra, and
Fatehpur Sikri, identified as
sensitive areas by the
Ministry of Environment and Forests and the CPCB, has to
be maintained at a high quality level, and all efforts
should be made towards attaining the standards, provided
as guidelines for such sensitive areas.
The Committee
recognised that air quality is strongly lnfluenced by
the current and future needs of various forms of energy
by all consumers, the availability of different types of
energy, the, conditions of
their utilisation, the
reliability of supplies, as well as their
cost and
alternatives among these supplies.
During the past 40
years, and especially during the last 20 years, there is
a growing realisation and aspiration the world over to
pursue rapid economic growth and simultaneously aim for
a cleaner and safer
environment, preserving to the
utmost the richness of natural heritage of the earth in
its
living,
non
living and cultural
resources.
Fortunately the spectacular advances in Science and
Technology are enabling most developed countries to
attain a high degree of success in the realisation of
such aspirations.
It is essential that Indian efforts
for
development and commitment for
economic growth
should
have
high
inputs
of
the
most
advanced
technologies, modified to suit Indian conditions.

With this in view, the Committee has striven to
gather information from a variety of sources on the
following:

*

State of monuments and changes in them during the
last 50 years.

*

Ambient air quality in the Taj Trapezium Zone, and
especially
in
the
vicinity of
monuments
in
different seasons
over the past 10 to 15 years,
including long term averages as well as short time
variations ..

*

Quantitative estimates of all forms of energy
available and utilised by different consumers such
as
households,
commercial
establishments,
transport,
hospitals,
offices,
hotels,
restaurants,
shops,
small,
medium
and
large
industries, and infrastructure.
