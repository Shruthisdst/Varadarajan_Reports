Based

on

the

laboratory

and

site

studies

on

"fresh",

"contemporary" and "monument" materials obtained from the Taj
Mahal complex and other structure, it may be concluded that the
"useful" life of the brick

line mortar composite in the Taj

Mahal which is shielded by cladding material (i.e,) marble or
sand stone will be in excess of 930 years as predicted by the
curves fitted through the laboratory data. This has been done by
defining the useful life of the materials as the life at which
the compressive strength of the material is reduced to 50% of the
strength of the "fresh" materials. This estimate is based on the
premise

that

the

materials

are

constantly

subjected

to

the

maximum levels of pollution which may not actually happen.
The

laboratory

pitting of

studies

the marble

also

indicate

cladding surface

that

staining

may occur

under

and
the

effects of NO x and Chlorides i the environments. This would lead
to a reductions in the lustre of the marble surface. A physical
examination of the present marble cladding in the Taj Mahal

also

validates this conclusion."
6. ASI's NEW TECHNIQUES QF CLEANING MARBLE:

'The

AS!

developed

a

technique

for

the

removal

of

yellowishness and other settled particulates on the surface. This
yellowiSh

has

been

removed

by

the

use

of

chemico-physical

absorption technique along with the particulates. The steps are
as following:1.

About

3%

amrnonical

liquor

with

a

surface

non-ionic

detergent like teepol - 300 and hydrogen peroxide in 3:2:1
for a general clean up in distilled water in methanol.
2.

Followed

by

the

use

of

triethanol-amine

in

suitable

proportions (1:2) for the removal of soot tarry deposits.
3.

Cleaning with distilled water.

4.

Absorption by Mg tri-silicate and AI-silicate in 1:4 ratio
again in distilled water with few drops of glycerol'.
