industries in existing locations in Agra would
need
installation of pipelines and meters.
This may be
expenslve
and in addition not ensure safety, as
accidental leakage in
pipeline network may lead to
explosions and fires. It may however be possible to use
LPG or HSD wi th sui table precautions, after
careful
review.
79. Capital costs of modifying existing units to adopt
Divided Blast Cupola for reduced coke consumption would
depend on capacities. Efficient well designed APeD with
cyclone separators, and wet gas scrubbers can provide
substantial improvements. The Report on Inspection of
Air Pollution Control Devices by NEERI dated AprilS,
1994 states that the efficiency is below 20 per cent in
two units and below 45 per cent in one,
among the four
inspected. NEERI Report
dated March 7, 1994 on
Fuel
Supply Alternatives (Annexure
) suggests Natural Gas
can be considered for use only in new industrial sites.
Other Industries in Agra
Almost all these can use LPG or low sulphur liquid
fuels in place of coal or firewood through suitable
modifications.
Here again, it will not be possible to
ensure safety for pipeline supply of Natural Gas in the
existing locations. Use of LPG or other liquid fuels
can be done after meeting requirements for
safety in
storage, according to regulations.

Ferozabad
81.
Ferozabad industries consume 700 MT of coal per
day.
Many have open pit furnaces.
Coal cannot be
replaced in such
furnaces by petroleum gas or liquid
fuels. There are a large number of tank furnaces and it
is possible to introduce oil firing. A large number of
workers have to be specifically trained. One major unit
has totally replaced coal usage and has
adopted
electrical
furnaces,
employing power
from
diesel
generators and using oil fired jet flame torches for
finishing
work
on high quality table glassware.
Ferozobad has a Technic'al Assistance Unit rendering very
useful service. It has to be strengthened substantially
and services of some experts from industry in developed
countrles could be obtained. Central Glass and Ceramic
Research Institute (CGCRI) Calcutta had made some
studies earller.
wi th a sui table sponsored programme of
research and demonstration, CGCRI will also be able to
provide valuable aSslstanCâ‚¬.
