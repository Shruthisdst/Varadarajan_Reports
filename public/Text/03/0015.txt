ITIMADUDDAULA
32.
The monument is in a site across the Jamuna
and is just off the main Jawahar bridge with traffic by
a variety of transport forms, including diesel lorries
and buses as well as
three and two wheelers.
The
monument has attractive highly inlaid marble walls on
the outer side, and paintings on the white plaster walls
and alcoves in the inner halls.
The marble
surfaces
have been cleaned by the clay pack technique, and
exhibit highly varied complex designs with wide ranging
coloured
stones.
Most of complex paintings on the
plaster covered walls
have deposits and incrustations
from soot and oil lamps.
ASI
have demonstrated that
these can be restored by painstaking solvent treatment.
Such work has been carried out only on a small portion.
It would be desirable to provide funds and facilities to
complete the restoration fully.

It would be advantageous to divert heavy vehicles
traffic away from this location.
The monument is not
visited by
many tourists and can be restored and
relatively easily conserved. There does not seem to be
any damage by atmospheric gaseous pollution. As in the
case of the Ta j Mahal, the red
sandstone does get
damaged and is being replaced.
AGRA FORT
34.
There are a large number of buildings where
marble has been used.
Excellent conservation work has
revealed the original spelendour of almost all of these.
Currently work is in progress on the Mati Masjid. The
marble everywhere is well preserved and is
being
conserved through clay pack technique.
The high SPM,
arising from sands and dust storms and other carbonaceous
materials in the atmosphere, causes deposition on marble
which is removable, and erosion as well as chipping of
sandstone are seen.
A substantial portion of the Fort
area, now with the Ministry of Defence, needs
to be
transferred to AS! for conservation.
FATEHPUR SIKRI
35.
This site is away from Agra city.
Industrial
activity is almost absent.
Most structures are of red
sandstone,
which show some damage as in the case of
other monuments. The marble structure of Shaikh Salim
Chishti's shrine, with marble
jaIis, is in good
condition, resulting from good maintenance, repairs and
special repairs, appropriate to this World Heritage
Monument.
