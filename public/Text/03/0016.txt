Taj Mahal on the outskirts of the present day city of
Agra. The
marble flooring appears to be affected by
erosion. The marble surfaces are relatively low. Due
to increase in the deer and black buck population and
grazing, the maintenance of green cover is proving to be
qui te demanding.
The state of conservation of
the
monument appears to be good. AS I and IOC are maintaining
air
monitoring stations at this site.
The volume of
traffic is
increasing here.
Green cover and
afforestation have to be
substantially enhanced to
maintain good air quality standards.
ASI are replacing
damaged red sandstones.
There is relatively
low
adornment of painting on plaster surfaces and inlay in
marble in the main structure. Gateway arches have inlay
marble in walls and this is in good condition. Damaged
marble flooring in the topmost storey of Akbar's Tomb
needs urgent repairs.
