sUPp~Jof 0.25 sUlfbur diesel in the Taj Trapezium from
1st I----I)
1996.
~ mOnths additionat time is required
after introduction of 0.5 sulphur diesel to segregate a
separate distribution system for 0.25 sulphur diesel.
However, it would mean that from 1st
1996 threedifferent varieties'of diesel would be marketed i.e.

a)

b)
c)

1% sulphur diesel for rest of the country
0.5% sulphur for the 4 metropolitan cities
0.25% sulphur for Taj Trapezium Area.

I am also to add here even this would be achieved by the oil
industry under very tight schedule and by ~mporting the quantities at the considerable higher cost.
