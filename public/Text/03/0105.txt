The monthly average concentration of sulphur dioxide
has certainly been observed to be less than 30 g/m 3 •
Though the structure is more than three and a hal f
centuries old and is exposed to atmospheric pollution, the
resilient quality of the marble has enabled it to withstand
the wear and tear of time. The chemical treatment of the
marble

has

removed

accretions

and

deposits,

thereby

restoring lustre to the surface of the building. This has
been measured by glass reflectance procedures.
The yellowish appearance on the surface as already
stated is due to the deposition of suspended particulate
matter,

smoke,

grease,

etc.,

although this phenomena has

been long manifested but there has been increase in the

attending to the cleaning of the marble
