month with maximum
amount of rainfall.
Records of
rainfall in the district are available for 8 raingauge
stations over a period of 90 years.
The statement of
rainfall at these stations and for Agra district as a
whole is given in Table 1 and Table 2. (Annexure IX).

Post Monsoon Season
48.
October and the first half of November form the
postmonsoon or transition period.
After the
withdrawal of the monsoon there is a slight increase in
the day temperatures during
the month of October but
nights become progressively cooler.
Skies are generally
clear or lightly clouded during this season.

49.
Table Nos. 3, 4 and 5 (Annexure X) give the
climatological normals of temperature and humidity, mean
wind speed, and special weather phenomena , respectively,
for Agra.

Wind
50.
The wind is the most important meteorological
parameter for transport and diffusion of air pollutants
in the atmosphere.
Thus the data on wind speed and
direction form the most important basis for assessment
of risk to the Taj Mahal
and other
monuments from
surrounding air poll ution sources.
The
poll utants,
while being transported downwind, also diffuse in the
cross-wind and vertical directions. This is controlled
by the
atmospheric stability.
Thus, these two
parameters viz, wind and the stability combine together
in determining the concentration of pollutants at a
given place.
51.
The India Meteorological Department maintains
a meteorological observatory near the Taj Mahal. Data
on wind
speed and direction are continuously being
monitored at this observatory, and the following broad
inferences are drawn from the analysis of long-term wind
data:(i)October to February are the months of light winds.
However, it is clearly brought out that the postmonsoon season is characterised by transition from the
southerly flow regime of South-west monsoon to a northwesterly flow.
