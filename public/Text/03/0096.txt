PRESENT STATUS OF TAJ

JAGAT PAT! JOSHI

The Taj Mahal
Shahjahan

was

built between

1631-1643 AD by Emperor

to enshrine the mortal remains of his queen Mumtaj

Mahal. Immediately after its construction in dome and galleries.
The repairs were

carried out

but details are

not

available.

Except a few examples of vandalism by Jats of Bharatpur
and by the soldiers of Lord Lake 1803 and between 1828 -

1833

Lord William Bentinks desired to demolish Taj and auction its
marble

which

attention

could

during

not

be

British

materialised,

period.

But

Taj

after

has

1942

received
structural

repairs were given a scientific footing and 1912 onwards in-depth
studies both for-material and environmental aspects were made.
The awareness for the structural and environmental conservation
of Taj has been tremendous which could be even gleaned from the
tri-media.

Presently

Taj

is

in

the

World

Heritage

List

and

receives constant attention and care by the Archaeological Surv.ey
of

India

(ASI).

on one hand shows the anxiety of Government of India and on the
other

gradual

and

' Inter

Disciplinary' approach for the preservation of Taj.
On Taj scientific researches are going on and whatever data
is available it is quite useful.

2. STRUCTURAL STABILITY OF TAJ
The studies carried out by the electro-resistivity method
by NGRI, Hyderabad and the study of soil profile by CBRI, Roorkee
indicated that the foundations are in a fairly good conditions
in respect of stability subsidence and material deterioration.
NGRI has further brought to light:
1.

"Magnetic, seismic and resistivity logging in bore holes on
Taj Mahal

side seems to indicate the foundation depth is

around 12m /
2.

13 m (138/139 R.L.).

Seismic amplitude studies indicate that the North boundary
wall thickness is not more than 3.0 m.
