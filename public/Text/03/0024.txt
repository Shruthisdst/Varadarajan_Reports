and at the Taj Mahal by mobile van as Mathura Refinery
does not maintain any flxed monitoring station at the Taj
Mahal. During the above period the refinery was shut down
for
major malntenance w.e.f. 23.3.1995 in a phased
manner. The startup of units was done sequntially w.e.f.
April, 2, 1995. The period of total unit shutdown was
from 26.3.95 to 2.4.95.
61.

Perusal of air quality data indicates the following:

(a). Farah Monitoring Station
During March, 1995, the 1- hour maximum reading of
micrograms/ cubic metre
was recorded prior to
refinery shutdown. The 24 hourly average concentration
corresponding to that day was 14.0 micrograms/ cubic
metre. During refinery shut-down the 1-hour maximum was
recorded 11.4 micrograms/ cubic metre and 24 hr. average
at 6.4 micrograms/ cubic metre. The effect of vehicular
traffic
pollution is reflected on certain days during
late night/ early morning hours and again towards late
evening hours.

b. Keetham Monitoring

Statio~

The 24 hour average concentration of Sulphur dioxide
recorded at keetham monitoring station before refinery
shutdown in March- Apr iI, 1995 was 5-6 micrograms/ cubic
metre with 1 hourly maximum at 13 micrograms/ cubic
metre. During refinery shutdown the reading came down to
3 micrograms/ cubic metre.
ec) Sikandra Monitoring Station
During March 95, Sikandra station recorded I-hour
maximum at 19 micrograms/ cubic metre, 24 hrly average
being 8-9 micrograms/ cubic metre. During refinery
shutdown 24-hour average concentration of Sulphur dioxide
was observed 6-7
micrograms/ cubic metre wi th peaks
remaining unchanged.
(d) Taj Mahal
The following points emerge from analysis of 1
hourly
average concentrations of Sulphur dioxide
monitored at Taj mahal by mobile van.
i.

The Sulphur dioxide concentrations are higher than
th ose monitored
at
all
the
fixed
stations
maintained by Mathura Refinery viz, Farah, Keetham
and sikandra in the Mathura-Agra region.
