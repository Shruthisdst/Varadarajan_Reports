The marble stone veneer cover1ng walls,
floors,
upper sides of domes t and chhatrls are fixed
with iron dowels rivetting adjoining stones. There is
some corrosion in these and those affected are replaced
by ASI from time to time as and when required. These
are also cracks between stones in the lime mortar and
these are attended to by using fresh infusions of
special mortar. The main outer floor of marble and some
marble slabs get affected because of the presence of a
large number of visitors as well as the force of water
jet falling from the spouts at high height
during
rainfall. These are also replaced. Due to the enormous
self load, some slabs do have cracks, mostly superfical,
and some are deeper, extending upto the masonary.
In
the view of experts,
these cracks are not due to
atmospheric pollution. They have advised the filling up
of wider cracks and replacement of the missing parts to
prevent water penetration into the structure and
corrosion of iron dowels.
iii) The white marble in the Taj Mahal is of varied
types
although quarried from the same area, Makrana,
with differences in colour, shade and grains.
In the
inner covered area, electric lamps using generator power
were introduced in 1911-12, and line power supply became
available in 1924-25. Until then, lighting inside could
only be effected through oil lamps and oil torches which
necessarily produced
soot and smoke materials which
deposited on surfaces.
Similarly,
some suspended
particles in the atmosphere and dust also had impinged
on the surface of the marble in the upper portions on
the outside.
At lower wall levels, due to contact on
account of touching by several thousand visitors every
day, some material deposits on surface.
26.
From 1987 onwards, ASI has vigorously adopted
a
physical absorption technique using activated clay
pack. The deposits are transferred in the course of a
few hours from the surface of the marble to the surface
of the acti vat~d solid
absorbent.
In this way, the
original colour and lustre of the
marble has been
restored in most outer surfaces. The present state of
surface seems quite satisfactory
and there is no
yellowing. Experts have differed on whether at any time
acrylic thin emulsion as a I.V.C. coat protection was
attemped,
and such
coating could have led to
discolouring.
However,
all experts
agreed that
presently there is no yellowing.
