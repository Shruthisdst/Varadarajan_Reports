A REPORT ON THE TAJ MAHAL AND OTHER MONUMENTS AT AGRA

- R. Sengupta
On the recommendation of the Expert Committee constituted by the
Ministry of Environment and Forests on the directionE of the Supreme
Court on the conservation and preservation of the Taj Mahal and
other monuments at Agra,it asked me in its letter no.Q-17012/21/93-CPw
dated 17th April,1995 to visit the Taj Mahal,Agra Fort,AkbarJs tomb
at Sikandra and the tomb of Itimaduddaula and report my independent
views on their present status,yellowing and its remedy,the time of
introduction of electric lights inside the Tai

~ah~l

and suggestions

for conservation measures.Accordingly 1 visited the monuments at
Agra on 19th,20th and 21st April,1995.
After visiting the Taj Mahal and discussing relevant issues with the
local officers of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI),I felt
that Structurally the present status of the monument is not in any
way different from what it was in the early sixties when I was lookina after the monument as Assistant Superintending Archaeological
Engineer (S€'pt. 1961 -

with the ACJra (Northern) Circl€'

of the ASI.ln my opinion,theretore,there is no cause tor alarm or
apprehension about its being ruined in the near future.My views are
supported by the report of the ASI's Superintending Archaeologist
that the Survey of India's recent check-up of levels (bench marks)
on the plinth and verticality of the minars showed no movement or
change in the stability of the structure.
It may be emphasized that the marble stones used on the Taj Mahal
are neither "Pure white" or "Pearl white" as oiven out in press
reports from time to time.The stones are a mixed lot,most of them
with greyish bands and some with brownish veins showing presence of
minerals.These minerals in contact with water in course of time
cause damage to the stones.The main causes of damages to stones
have already been identified and mentioned in the report of the
Expanded Advisory Committee on the Restoration and Conservation of
the Taj Mahal at Agra 1943 and require no repeatation.However the
cracks in the vaulting on the second floor,mentioned in the report
are not "alive" i.e. do not show any movement of the structure.
These cracks I

feel might have developed due to the devastating

earthquake shocks of mid-thirties in Bihar when cracks in buildings
at Allahabad also had appeared.A survey of old buildings ar.d churche~
at Allahabad by me (while restoring the Muir College of the
