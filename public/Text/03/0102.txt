A

scrutiny

of

details,

indicate that the marble of Taj is still in a satisfactory
condition and its conversion to sulfates etc, is still very
rare as SEM analysis revealed a number of formations at the
surface

result

of

depositions, a number of inclusions like elemental sUlphur

YELLOWISHNESS OF MARBLE

The yellowishness of the marble has been attributed to the
main causative factor which is settleable particulate getting
deposited on the surface containing carbonaceous matter. Since
no chemical reaction is involved between the carbonate of the
marble

and

the

deposited

aerosols

it

may

be

termed

as

a

superficial deposit and poses no major problems for its removal.
The marbles at Acropolic Athens, Field Museum Ch'icago and
Taj Mahal are similar. While the sulphates that form due to S02
at tack

on

the

marble are

al together

absent

at

the

Ta j .

At

Acropolis and the Field Museum they form a black crus and have
penetrated into integranular space of marble. This is based on
observations of K.L. Gowri.

liThe results

of cleaning and observations carried out on different parts of
the Taj Mahal including four minarets,

and also on the other

marble monuments visited allow to conclude that the yellow shadow
of the marble is mainly due to suspended particulates matter and
also to dust fall impinging on the surface. This is in agreement
with the report by o.P. Agarwal

et el

(NRLC, Lucknow, Nov.1986)

and the report by B.N. Tandon (ASI Dehradun, 5th Report,
