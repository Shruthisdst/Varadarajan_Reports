The Refinery was commissioned in 1982. The
quality monitoring stations established at about 10
km intervals in the direction from Mathura to the Taj
Mahal (a distance of 43
kIn) by IOC,
Uttar Pradesh
pollution Control Board (UPPCB),
Central Pollution
Control Board (CPCB), and the Archaeological Survey of
India (ASI) have, in the period 1982 to 1995, generally
confirmed the estimates made by the Expert Committee in
1977 wi th
regard to the level of sulphur dioxide in
different locations
between the Refinery and the Taj
Mahal. The Expert Cornmi ttee t s recommendation that steps
may be taken to ensure that no new industry, including
small industries or other units, which can
cause
pollution are located north-west of the Taj Mahal, has
been
enforced. However, efforts to relocate existing
small industries, particularly the foundries, in an area
south-east of Agra beyond the Taj Mahal, have not been
successful.

5.
The CPCB defined an area named as Ta j Trapezium
Zone,
(see fig. 1), and
recommended that industrial
activities in the Zone may be regulated. This has been
observed strictly. There has however been an increase
in
non-industrial commercial
activities such as
construction of buildings and roads,
production of
bricks from coal burning kilns, shops, restaurants, and
various categories of hotels to meet
the needs of
tourism.
In particular, there has been a large increase
during the past 7 years in the numbers of two and three
wheeler road vehicles, cars, lorries and buses in areas
close to the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and Itimad ud-Daula
and increased DG sets in commercial area and Hotels.
