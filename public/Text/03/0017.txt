Skies are generally clear in winter season
except when
the area is affected by passing western
disturbances and cloudiness may increase for a day or
two. Nearly 5\ of the annual rainfall is accounted for
by the winter rains. occasional fogs also occur during

The atmosphere is stable for a much longer
duration during winter season in comparison to other
seasons.
Due to this
meteorological phenomenon,
disperson of air pollutants is
suppressed to a large
extent resulting in localised high
concentrations of
pollutants emitted from low sources when winds are very
light during night time in winter months.

June, resulting in appreciable drop in day temperatures
(about 5-6°C) and sudden increase in relative humidity.
The mean daily maximum
temperature is around 34°C.
Although there is no appreciable change in mean daily
minimum temperature yet due to high humidity, oppressive
conditions often prevail during night time.

About 90 percent of the annual rainfall is received
