-3For better preservation and maintenance of the monument it is suggested for consideration that the vehicular traffic between the riverside road on the east of Agra Fort and the Taj Mahal be diverted to
keep the area free from vehicular traffic and gaseous emissions from
vehicles.An area on the east of the Taj Mahal,near Silpgram,be developed for parking of tourist vehicles.The burning ghat (for cremation of dead bodies)close to the spurs behind the monument may be
shifted to avoid smoke affecting the monument.
In February last shooting of a Tamil

film with casts caused damages

to the garden inside.Earlier in the sixties when the Hindi film
"Leader" was being shot,the garden had suffered considerable damages
and thereafter shooting of film inside with casts was discontinued:
shooting of films inside should be totally stopped.
Aforestation on the river-side land,behind the Taj Mahal,seems to
be an incongruity and should be discouraged.
As entry of large number of visitors at a
the tomb chamber above is hazardous tor

and entry to the tomb chamber above it restricted to 20 at a time,
as practised at Ajanta Caves.
It appears there are proposals to construct barrages across the
river to impound waters tor boating to promote tourism,After the
spurs W0re constructed the river course has undergone changes.Before
any further construction is planned the behaviour of the river should be studied to avoid any adverse effect on the river-side monuments.
Inside the Agra fort,the damaged marble flooring of the courtyard
of the Moti Masjid was replaced with new stones over two decades ago.
Though the condition of the stones is generally good, some pieces of
poor quality show pitting, scaling etc.On the outer face of the dalans
and inside the Masjid there are areas blackened by smoke. Similarly,
the jalis of the Muthamman Burj (where Shahjahan was kept imprisoned
by his son Aurangzeb) and the ceiling are also covered with black
patina.Obviously these places have not been chemically treated for
cleaning.In this respect the cleaned walls of the Diwani Khas demo'nstrate that the diBcolouring is superficial and can very well be
cleaned withcut disturbing the fabric of stones. The cleaned walls
