76. In many developed countries very substantial number
of industrial units of varied capacities have been in
operation in areas close to residential areas. A large
percentage of the population in these countries live in
urban areas, which have also high energy usage through
heating, air conditioning, transport, home appliances,
commercial
establishments,
medicare,
entertainment,
sports, education, and leisure activities. In Developed
Wor Id
energy consumption per capita from coal, gas,
petroleum is 50 to 100 times compared to India. Yet to
meet standards, new energy efficient, environmentally
acceptable, and safe, risk free technologies have been
developed for industry and services.
By selection of
such technologies and their modification and adaptation
to meet specific conditions in Agra Mathura, the ambient
air quality could be improved. These aspects are
discussed below:
Foundries
77.
New divided cupolas have been introduced by a few
units in Agra foundries and these allow heated effluent
air to pre heat the intake air.
This has resulted in
marked improvement in
energy efficiency.
Coke usage
which is normally one tonne for
production of four
tonnes of steel has been improved so that one tonne of
coke is able to produce 8 to 10 tonnes of steel. With
further design improvements it is possible to achieve a
ratio of 1 to 12.
Professor P.Ramachandra Rao, Director
and
Dr.K.K.Mishra,
Deputy
Director,
National
Metallurgical Laboratory, Jamshedpur in discussions with
this Committee have confirmed their willingness
to
evolve demonstration units of three sizes for adoption in
Agra foundry industry. A preliminary proposal received
is being
examined for support by the Ministry of
Environment and Forests.
One hundred and ten foundry
units in Agra have each separately addressed identical
communications' to this Committee, confirming their
decision to instal Divided Blast Cupola.
They
have
sought financial assistance.

NML are also will'ing to develo'P furnaces which can
use gas or petroleum liquid fuels. The main costs are
in imported burners of special design available from a
limited number of suppliers. NML is eveloping their own
designs, and this aspect is
also included in the NML
project proposal.
