PITTING

Marble slabs have developed small pits at some points
under

the water spouts due to preferential

leaching

of minerals present as patches. These pits should be
sealed with epoxy resin. Ways and methods have to be
thought of to divert the rain water somehow so that
it does not fall through the spouts.
