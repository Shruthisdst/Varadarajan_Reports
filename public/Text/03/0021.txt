Sulphur dioxide (Period 1987-1993)
iv.

The trend analysis shows that ambient Sulphur
dioxide concentrations (annual mean) is increasing
every year since 1987.

v.

The monthly mean values of Sulphur dioxide were
however, always found to be within 30 micrograms/
cubic metre except in the winter of 1992.

vi

All the peaks in the monthly mean values were
observed in the winter months.

The rising trend in Sulphur dioxide concentrations
may be due to the fact that inspite of closing down of
coal based thermal power
plants and stopping of coal
based locoshed at Agra Fort
Marshalling yard, the
increase in vehicular traffic and extensive use of DG
sets for domestic, commercial and industrial purposes
throughout the city in the absence of reliable electric
power supply has resulted in slowly reversing the good
air quality observed during 1981-1985.
NO x (Period 1981-1985)

i.

The levels of NO concentration were high during the
above
period. "The mean monthly values generally
exceeded
20
micrograms/
cubic metre
to
50
micrograms/ cubic metre except during monsoon
seasons.

ii

All the peaks in the monthly mean were found in the
winter months.

NO x (Period 1987-1993)
iii. There is a continuous decreasing trend of monthly
mean Nitrogen dioxide
levels at the Taj Mahal.
Mostly the 90 percentile values are less than 30
micrograms/ cubic metre, except a peak of 55
microgram~/ cubic metre in 1988. Apart from
1987,
the monthly mean Nitrogen dioxide levels have
always been less than 20 micrograms/ cubic metre.
iv.

Over the past few years tree plantations have been
made
around the Taj and some restrictions about
heavy vehicular
traffic have been made near the
Taj. There may have had some effect on the monthly
mean Nitrogen dioxide levels in the area I but a
full explanation for reduction of Nitrogen dioxide
concentrations at the Taj inspite of increase in
consumption of petroleum products in Agra is not
