Pandeya has remarked:

" The white lustre of Taj

Mahal is very much present as on today. The quality of marble
used at all the places in Taj is not uniform. The good quality
white marble has been used for graves, Jali around cenotaph and
the lower floral

designs.

All these areas can be brought

to

original by simple bentonite and water cleaning. On rest of the
areas marble used has bands of inherent impurities and hence have
different shades. The corridor and interior portions of Taj have
remained neglected for centuries and so it has turned yellowish
due to deposition of dust, dirt and entrapped smoke emitted by
burning of candles,

incense sticks and the smoke emitted by

different modes around Taj in the past, prior to stopping coal
engines at Agra Fort, Railway year and the Thermal Power House
etc, The exterior parts of cenotaph of Taj has the same white
luster as before.

Apart from rains,

cleaning of Taj has been

mostly from outside in the past.
There

is

evidence

right

from

early

days

soon

after

completion of Taj upto as late as now that rain water is seeping
through domes and arches. During the seeping of water,
entered the main structure buil t

it has

of Lahheri bricks and

lime

plaster, which in turn has dissolved the soluble parts of the
material used. This has resulted in some permanent staining and
weakening

of

marble

from

inside

wherever

it

has

remained

stagnated behind the inlaid marble slabs and also on where it
flowed over through the joints and on the floor (Plates 3 & 4).
It has caused some permanent damage like resulting of dowels,
joint pins and disintegration of marble surface near joints. All
this has already happened in the past and now complete water
tightening of roof and walls is urgently required.
Biological weathering is occurring fast at Taj Mahal. Right
at the base of cenotaph, algal blooms (Myxophycease) are coming
On the outer walls and domes both on sandstone and
up
marble structures, algal blooms and even angiospermic plants have
started invasion

All this directly proves

that S02 in the atmosphere is not in effective lethal dose".
