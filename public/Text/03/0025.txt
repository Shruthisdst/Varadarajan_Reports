ENERGY FORMS AVAILABILITY AND UTILISATION
Electric Power

62.
The cleanest forms of energy, wherever it can be
readily utilised, is electrical energy supplied from the
Regional
Grid.
It appears that the supply in Taj
Trapezium Area from the UP Electricity Board is grossly
inadequate and is not reliable at present.
These are
frequent unplanned stoppages and fluctuations.
Supply
to industries in Agra is not made on Wednesdays and
therefore many remain closed on Wednesdays. It is learnt
that the transformers on the distribution system need to
be augumented
and some have to be replaced.
Without
such steps, even when
power supply from the grid is
available, distribution fails.
63.
The Committee has not been able to obtain any
information regarding the present supply and future
plans.
A letter dated 24 April 1995 from the Special
Secretary, Ministry of Power, is placed in Annexure XIV.
