University) showed cracks in the upper regions reportedly appeared

in the thirties.
The causes for appearence of cracks enlisted by the Expanded Advisory
Committee are still valid.Subsequent to the Committee's findings,
large scale replacements of damaged marble stones, including those
on the dome,were carried out in 1949.Earlier such major restorations
were executed in 1810 and 1874,as per records.So replacement of
damaged stones with new ones and corroded iron dowels with ones of
non-corrosive metal is done occassionally as per requirements.
Some areas on the outer face of the Taj Mahal show light yellowing
which could be attributed to deposition of suspended particulate
matters,but no corrosion,to speak of could be seen.Areas of yellowing could be cleaned effectively by chemical tratment and the original- colour of the stone restored.! do not think burning of oil lamps
had produced yellowing as discolouration of stones is also seert on
monuments inside the Agra Fort and the tomb of Itimaduddaula.The
Superintending Archaeologist of Agra Circle has informed that electric lamps were introduced in 1911 and a generator was used to light
them and probably after 1924 regular electricity was made available.
Incidentally it may be pointed out that awareness about pollution
was created by officers of the ASl who kept vigil on important monuments and obtained results ot latest

Fort and the shunting Railway engines burning coal were identified
as sources causing pollution only in 1972,earlier nobody spoke abcut
marbles yellowing. Neither the Expanded Advisory Committee of 1943
nor the Committee of CPWD engineers detected the discoloration in
July,l956.But from the nature of discolouration seen at untreated
portions of Agra Fort,it appears the phenomenon is older than 23
years i.e. of pre-l972 time.People became conscious of yellowing of
stones of the Taj Mahal only after the debate on Mathura Refinery
gathered momentum.
