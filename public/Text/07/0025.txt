cares very deeply about the plight of Bhopal's gasaffected survivors. legally, he asserts blamelessness.
He defends the management of the plant. Corporately,
he stands together with the U.S. parent company. The
trouble is that the parent isn't standing together with

by Carbide in Danbury. The parent firm believes that
because mistakes were made in Bhopal, and because
UCIl had full managerial responsibility, then the case
should be shifted to India. "Fifty years of contributions to Indian society seem to have disappeared after
this tragedy," Gokhale laments.
So although Carbide and UCIl both believe that
the place of trial should be India, no one really wants
a trial. All parties, except for various activist groups

There is a continuing vastness to the subject of
Bhopal, one year after the calamity that so rocked the
conscience of the chemical industry. The lesson then, aE

and in the rest of the world. Workshops and symposia
on industrial and community safety are densely scheduled. The chemical world has learned, because industrial disasters-so enormously wasteful of money, human energy, and long-built reputations-do teach. C
