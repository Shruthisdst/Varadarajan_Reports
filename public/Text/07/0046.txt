tor, could have entered the non pressurised tank and may have carried some metallic contaminants from the carbon steel portions of header pipe1ine~. The rapid rise in temperature necessitates onset of metal catalysed polymerisation and could not result from water alone. The presence
of chloroform has no influence whatsoever in initiating or accelerating the run-away reactions. The
quantum of leakage is related not to the quantum of water but to the amount of MIC stored in a
single container. If 42 tonnes of MIC had been stored in 210 stainless steel drums instead of a single
tank, leakage by reactions or spillage would be no more than one fifth of a tonne.
Public preparedness for eventualities are dependent on information available on the toxicity
and hazards. It appears that the factors that led to the toxic gas leakage and its heavy toll existed
in the unique combination of properties of MIC and from the features of design of the plant.
Storage of large quantities of such a material for unnecessarily long periods in single large tanks was
made possible by the facilities installed. Insufficient caution in design, in choice of materials of
construction and in instruments, together with lack of facilities for safe effective quick disposal of
materials showing instability contributed to the event and to the adoption of guidelines and practices in operation and maintenance. The combination of conditions for the accident were inherent
and extant. Some inputs of integrated scientific analysis of the chemistry, design and controls
relevant to the manufacture would have avoided or lessened considerably the extent of damage.
