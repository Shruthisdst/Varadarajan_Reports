Assumptions
i.

The above reactions represent initial
reactants and final products without
specifying possible intermediates.

ii.

Chloroform present could entel' into
reactions only above 200 0 C. at which
stage, all the water present would have
been consumed by reaction with MIC.
Chloroform or its thermal decomposition products could be available to
react with DMU or TMB to produce
the Dione.

iii.

iv.

The formation of DMI takes place at
high temperatures. It is assumed that
N-alkylureas are converted to DMI with
the simultaneous formation of alkylamines.

v.

Phosgene
(COCI2) and MCC (CRa
NHCOCI) present in very small amounts
are readily hydrolysed with water to
give hydrogen chloride.

vi.

A part of the chlorine of chlorofonn

is converted to hydrogen chloride.
The hydrogen chloride produced is
present in part as hydrochloride of
amines and as metal chlorides.

Based on the chemical reactions described
above, a material balance has been worked
