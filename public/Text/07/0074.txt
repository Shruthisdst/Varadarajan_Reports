Carrier gas .. nitrogen (30 ml/min)

Quantitation method .. internal standard

Detector temperature - 3000 C

Several compounds were tried as internal
standards, out of which dibutyl phthalate was
selected since its retention time did not interfere with any other component of the sample
matrix.

Standard solutions with

Total analysis time .. 15 min

Standard solutions of all the compounds with
equal amounts of internal standard were prepared. Concentrations of these standard solutions had a wide range. This was necessary for
area matching as in the case of external standard.
