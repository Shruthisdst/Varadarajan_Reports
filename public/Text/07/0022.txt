from Madhya Pradesh authorities, broke into thiosulfate dispensaries run by volunteer phYSicians, arrested
them, and confiscated the thiosulfate supplies.
liThe cyanide issue is important not merely for its
biomedical/toxicological aspects," declares morcha leader Sadgopal, a biochemist who received a Ph.D. in
1968 from California Institute of Technology under
James Bonner. liThe real importance lies in the legal
ramifications. To us it is important because a serious
attempt would be made by Carbide lawyers to establish that a large portion of the lung damage can be
explained by such things as endemic tuberculosis. It is
at this point that the issue of cyanide toxicity would
become crucial because if you can establish that so
many thousands of people received clinical benefit
from sodium thiosulfate injections and you have a
clinical record, then you have established that they
were suffering from cyanide or cyanide like toxicity. If
sodium thiosulfate gives relief, it is a specific antidote
and its effect is shown by a specific chemical urine
test for thiocyanate. High levels of it in urine would
measure the amount of exposure."
What Sadgopal did manage to do, with the legal
help of a Bombay activist lawyer, Indira Jaisingh, was
to win an order by the chief justice of the Indian
Supreme Court. The chief justice instructed the Madhya
Pradesh government to allow the distribution of thiosulfate to volunteer groups, like the People's Medical
Center, to continue their treatment. Sadgopal says his
case was strengthened by Heeresh Chandra, chief
pathologist at Gandhi Medical College in Bhopal.
Chandra had been one of the first to detect symptoms
of cyanide poisoning and to this day continues to
insist that cyanide is still being generated in patients
and that thio3ulfate therapy is useful. What helped,
too, were the March recommendations in favor of
thiosulfate by Ramalingaswami's ICMR, which Madhya

Pradesh phYSiCians refused to a:ct upon. In a development last month, Sadgopal and Jaisingh also convinced the chief justice to appoint Sadgopal and forensic scientist Chandra to a seven-member committee with direct oversight over the entire clinical
program in Bhopal.
The cyanide issue, scientifically speaking, appears
to have two aspects. One is direct exposure, which
could have occurred during the first hours in the
areas closest to the plant. The technical book on this
one is closed, although the mystery of why exposure
was so vehemently denied by officialdom isn't. The
second aspect is indirect exposure owing to unusual
generation of toxic amounts of hydrogen cyanide in
the body after exposure to MIC.
"The way the ICMR scientists have explained the
mechanism of cyanide generation makes some sense,"
says biochemist Sadgopal. "That is the concept of the
body's cyanogen pool generating cyanidelike radicals
continuously in the bloodstream. When released, they
could hook onto the hemoglobin, or to some other
enzyme, or to cytochrome oxidase (a key respiratory
enzyme). They could either block the respiratory system at the cellular !-evel or modulate the behavior of
the hemoglobin in releasing or carrying oxygen.
"Now, the sources that feed into the hypothetical
cyanogen pool could be many. One possibility could
be MIC linked to a peptide or amino acid, which is
gradually hydrolyzed by enzyme action. Then MIC
could be converted into thioisocyanate by the transfer
of sulfur from thiosulfate. Thioisocyanate existing in
equilibrium with thiocyanate is one possibility."
The scheme, though general, does make some hy.
pothetical biochemical sense. MIC binds to hemoglobin in a carbamylation reaction. That binding was a
common clinical observation at Bhopal. (The isocyanatehemoglobin reaction is used to some advantage
