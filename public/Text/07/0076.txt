Detennination of amines

Retention times of amines were as follows:

Various columns were investigated for the
separation and quantitative analysis of amines
by GLe. The column described below was
developed and was found to be suitable for
the quantitative estimation of amines.

Monomethylamine

3.85 min

Dimethylamine

5.29 min

Trimethylamine

5.99 min

Sample Preparation

Reliability Test

About 1 g of the sample was extracted with
50 ml water and injected in the Gas Chromatograph. The percentages of amines were calculated directly.

Standard Solutions
Standard mixture, containing MMA, DMA
and TMA were prepared from the corresponding standard solutions of amines. Standard
solutions (0.5t1zl) were injected into the Gas
Chromatograph. The ID Table was prepared
and filed. The reliability of the method was
checked by injecting known concentration
of the amines in the Gas Chromatograph.
