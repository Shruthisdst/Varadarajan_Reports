the following statements can be made:

The reaction of MIC with small quantities of water and chloroform at 250 0 C
gives all the products formed in tank
610 with the exception of tetramethyl
biuret. Formation of amines and amine
hydrochlorides was also noticed.

Compounds found in the residue can be
accounted for by the reaction of MIC
with small quantities of water and chloroform.
Assuming the residue composition, and
the nature and quantity of eac~ chemical
entity present as given in Table 2.9, the following stoichiometric equations can be written
for the chemical reactions involved:

Discussion:

Based on the above observations and on the
composition of the residue given in Table 2.7,
