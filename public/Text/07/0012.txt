Technical P R Campaign
A suggestion was made to the Government of India to mount a Technical Public Relati"ons Campaign both in India and the USA. This was felt necessary since the media reporting appeared biased
and inadequately informed about the chemical and technological realities of the Bhopal gas leak
tragedy. A broad plan of action was also suggested.
The Government of India reacted favourably and constituted a Group in which CSIR was
represented.

On CSIR's suggestion, Mr Wil Lepkowski, Senior Editor, Chemical and Engineering News,
American Chemical Society, USA was invited to visit India to see some of the CSIR laboratories
and selected chemical and petrochemical industries in the private as well as public sectors. The
objective was to provide an opportunity for one of the most reputed professional journals in the
world to get a first hand impression of the research and design engineering capabilities of Indian
scientists as well as their ability to run chemical plants safely. The visit was handled by CSIR with
excellent cooperation from the Department of Chemicals and Fertilizers, the Ministry of External
Affairs, the Government of Madhya Pradesh, ICMR, Department of Environment-. IPCL, HOC and
the National Organic Chemical Industries Ltd. Mr. Lepkowski's lengthy article in Chemical and
Engineering News of 2 December 1985 (first anniversary of the tragedy), reproduced here on the
assumption the publishers will not have any objection to our doing so, reflected the Indian viewpoints and commented favourably on the scientific and technological talent and imagination of
Indian scientists and engineers.
