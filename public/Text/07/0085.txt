ANNEXUTE 3.1

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE;
a) The reactions at atmospheric pressure and
room temperature were carried out either
in a pyrex or stainless steel tube with a
loosely fitting cork through which a thermometer was fixed to observe the temperature
of the reaction. The rise in temperature due
to the exothermic reaction was noted. In
the reaction, wherein a trace of iron catalyst
was added (Expt. No. 17 of Table A-a.l),
after an induction period of about 1 hr a
vigorous trimerization reaction set in. The
temperature rapidly rose to 4045 0 C, and
!vi1C boiled off through the loosely fitting
cork.
b) The reactions were carried out in closed
stainless steel bombs at specified tempera-

78

tures and predetermined times as given in
Table A-a.l. The bombs were cooled to ooC
or less and the product extracted, first
with acetone and then with water. The
residue from the acetone extract was subjected to direct GLC analysis. Both an
OV-210 plus OV ..17 on a chromosorb
column, which shows tetramethylbiUIet
(TRl\1B) as a clear separate peak and FF AP
on a chromosorb column, were used for
analysis. Details of analytical instrumental
conditions and methods of standardisation
and peak matching are in Annexure 2.
The values in parentheses reported
in
column 7 of Table A-3.1 represent the
approximate percentages of these components present in the total acetone extract
for the particular experiments.
