Dione
Dione was prepared by condensation of methylal with 1,3,5Â· trimethyl biuret in sulfuric
acid. The purity was confirmed by M.P. and
spectral data.

About 20 g of the sample was extracted
with about 150 ml of toluene under reflux.
The hot toluene solution was decanted from

on cooling were filtered off and recrystallised
from toluene and characterised by IR, NMR
