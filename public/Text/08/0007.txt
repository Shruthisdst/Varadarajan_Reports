Prior to the formation of the Working Group by the NeST,

Dr Varadarajan had submitted a report on R&D as a Chairman of
the Working Group constituted by the Action Committee on Public
Enterprises.

This report was submitted in 1973 and recommended

certain lines of action for promotion of various aspects of R&D
in the PSEs.

The Action Committee on Public Enterprises had sub-

mitted a report to Government based on the report of the Working
Group.

In constituting this NeST Working Group the NeST had

included the members of the earlier Working Group of the Action
Committee and in addition included Director General, Bureau of
Public Enterprises, Chairman, SCOPE and OGTO.

Discussions in

the first meeting and in the meeting of the light and medium
engineering group of Public Enterprises revealed that there was not
much additional work that could be performed by theNCST Working
Group at that stage.

The NCST Plan on Science and Technology had just been drawn

up and the PSEs were still in the preliminary stage of exercise on
the implementation of this plan.

The Action Committee had just

submitted their report which had gone into the depth of the varioUS
aspects of the ROD.

These factors further confirred the view that

the present Working Group could not undertake any substantial
additional work.at that stage.

In March 1977 the Chairman of the Working Group

Dr Varadarajan had a meeting with Or A Ramachandran, Secretary,
Department of Science and Technology.

The work already done by the

Working Group and the fUrther plan of action was discussed.

It was

felt that the time was now opportune to review the recommendations
of the Action Committee on ROD in PSEs and the progress made so far
in implementing the NeST Plan.
