updated on a continuous basis.

The recommendations have already

been made in paras 13 to 25 for the evolution of effective institutional arrangements for identification of specific ROD problems.
The evolution of technological standards for improvement of
quality, productivity, etc. may have to be dono at the industry
level and be reviewed periodically by means of arrangements
therein.

The Werking Group recommends, therefore, that these

standards be evolved and administered on the basis of the
recommendations contained earlier and would refrain from laying
down any specific standards of technological performance.
COOPERATION WITH NATIONAL LABORATORIES
27.

There is scope for much greater cooperation with National

Laboratories than exists at present.

Improvement in the general

environment in ROO in public enterprises, for which suggestions
have been made earlier, will contribute generally to greater cooperation.

In addition, new organisational and institutional forms

will be required.
(a)

Some recommended forms are :

Creation of Cells within the National Laboratories
composed of a small group of scientific staff from
among the leboratory staff, which will devote
themselves

w~

oIly

to tho needs of a specific

public sector enterprise.

The expenses incurred

on the Cell can be met by the PSEs on long term
contract.
(b)

Nomination of a Senior Scientist in the Laboratory
as a contact scientist for aPSE.

(c)

Nomination of individual ROD scientists in laboratories
on Boards of PSEs.
