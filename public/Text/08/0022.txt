Ethylone-vinyl acetate
copo4rmer.

IPCL has taken up this proj oct. Preliminary studio s to establish the feasibility
of copolymorising ethylene aJ.ld vinyl aceta to
using Ziegler-Natta ca~st are in progress in the R&D Laboratoxy. Results shGi
tha t using metal (aoetyl acetonates) and
trialkyl aluminjums as catalyst, vinyl
