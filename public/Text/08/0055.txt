MHO 2-5 MW Laboratory
Scale experiments.

A project is under progress for extracting mono-crysta~ne scilicon~ by FZ
process.
- BHEL also has a programme for the development of power thyristors.

A joint project between 05T, BHEL and
BARe is under progress for the development of a 5 MW MHO demonstration power
plant b2sed on coal gas. BHELls responsibility ip this project is mainly
for the development of hardware required
for the project.

- Fuel Efficiency,

Efficient fuel oil burning
- BHEL has established a liquid fuel
equipment
burning test rig to dovelop efficient
combustion equipment, ignitors and
flame s8nsi~g and monitoring systems.

- To improve fuel efficiency BHEL has
other projects such as fluidized combustion boiler which is presently in
an advanced stage of testing and~
conversion from oil to coal fired
boilers.
