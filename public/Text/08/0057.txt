Preliminary 150 MW Dual Cycle

BHEL is setting up a prototype combined
cycle demonstration plant Wased on
gasified coal and a gas turbine.
BHEL has also examined the feasibility
of converting the Namrup Station into
a combined cycle station and has got
clearance to go ahead with the project.
- A project for the development of a coal
gasifier is in progress.
- BHEL has a joint programme in the area
of coal gasification with RRL, Hyderabad
- Also BHEL is the convenor of the Steering Committee set up by the Ministry
ef Energy to examine conversion of the
Avon Engine for power generation.

Thermal Stations
R&D to improve utilisation

- visits, diagnosis,
'workshop' meeting.

BHEL has Research and Product Development
Centres for all its products. At each of
these centres studies are being made
to improve the product and thereby increase
the availability of thermal power stations.
Also BHEL has set up a system for monitoring BHEL equipment in thermal power
stations a~ initially the performance of
6 pnwer stations is being measured.
