Oxidation of

p-~lene

IPOL has taken up this project. Preliminar,y studies to incorporate manganese as
co-cata~st in para-~lene oxidation was
carried out in the R&D Laboratory and has
been found to be promising. Extensive
study will be taken up when the gas-liquid
oxidation reactors become available as a
result of EIL-IPCL joint R&D programme on
pa.ra-~lene oxidation \.m.iah is being taken
up short4r.

The project is taken up by HooL in collaboration with NCL, Poona. A number of
catalysts suitable for Aniline manufacture
have been prepared and tested.

Block cop~ers of St.yrene and butadiene.

IPCL propose to take up this proj ret
shortly.

Terpo~ers

IPCL has started this project but could
not continm owing to non-availability of
polymer grade ethylene and propylene.
This project will l::e continued as soon as
the raw rna -00 rial s become available.
