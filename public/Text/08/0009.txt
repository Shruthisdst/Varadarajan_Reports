market the roJe of ROD in adaptation and assimilation of technology
cannot be overstressed.

Industrial Research Design and Development can most

efficiently be carried out within the enterprise, provided a
sUitable environment can be created in the enterprise for promoting
ROD.

The factors favouring 'in house' ROD are many.

The

enterprise has an intimate knowledge of its own strengths and
weaknesses and can readily direct available RDD resources to the
most relevant areas.

The ROD personnel will have full knowledge and

participation in the successes and failures and this will provide
strong motivation for ROD. All information concerning the detailed
operational parameters of the enterprise will be readily available
to ROO personnel along with the objectives of the enterprises.

'In house' ROO is vital also for meaningful Â·cooperation

between National Laboratories and the enterprises.

This is because,

it would be necessary to clearly identify the specific areas and
problems and their priorities before they can be tackled by National
Laboratories.

further, once laboratory solutions are obtained for

problems it would be necessary to transplant them into the industrial
environment.

Both these activities would require effective ROD set

up in the enterprises themselves.

or ROD ON A SOUND BASIS IN PUBLIC SECTOR UNITS

The NeST Working Group reviewed the recommendations made

by the Action Committee's Working Group on organisation of ROD within
the public sector and relationship with national laboratories.

In

the light of this review, the amended recommendations of the Group
are being made.

Most of these recommendations relating to the

establishment of ROD on a sound basis in public enterprises would be
applicable not only to the public sector units in heavy engineering,
