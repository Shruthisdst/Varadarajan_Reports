Organisation of ROD in the PSEs
Each manufacturing enterprise regardless of its size,

should appoint a full time ROD Director or Manager on its Board
or its Executive Management Committee charged with corporate
responsibility for overall ROO input and performance including
commissioning ROD outside the

enterprise.

If suitable personnel

of high calibre are not immediately available, a part time
Director/Consultant may be aPPointed.
Major enterprises should create their own ROD laboratories
suited to their needs; the Head of the Laboratory may, if found
suitable, also be the Corporate ROD Director/Manager.

Smaller

enterprises, which also will have an ROD Director/Consultant,Â· may
use the services of other laboratories.
Although it is necessary that major enterprises create their own
ROD laboratories, research work need not wait fOr the creation of
their leboratories Or be confined to their own laboratories only.
The use of National l2boratories as also the lRboratories in other
public sector enterprisos should be encouraged to the maximum extent
possible so that f8cilities created in the country can be used
to the maximum advantage.
The ROO laboratories attached to PSEs may, apart from undertaking their own research, also act as coordinating agencies for
ROD purchased from abroad Or to be farmed out to other laboratories
in the country.
