Antipollution equipment

A fully instrumented experimental electrostatic precipit~tor has been set up in
the Ennore Powe Station to study the
behaviour and control of particulate
emission under varying conditions.

Waste Heat Boilers (Fuel
Efficiency)

A nation-wide survey was carried out in .
the area of waste heat boilers. BHEl
has in the past designed and manufactured
waste heat boilers. It has recently
completed a feasibility study on the
Namrup Station for which a clearance to
undertake the project has-been received.

R&D activities in the area of solar
energy based on solar thermal energy and
on converting solar thermal energy into
mechanical/electrical energy are in
progress. In the first group projects
on heating and cooling such as domestic
solar water heater, space heating are
being carried out and in the second
projects such as solar pumps and minipOWer plants.
BHEL has also been nominated by DST as
the Coordinator for all national
projocts in thL area of solar collector
development.
