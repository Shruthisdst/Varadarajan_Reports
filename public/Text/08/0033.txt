Geochemistry of dispersed sedimentarJ organic matters of Tertiary
and pretertiary sequences of P00r1y explored sedimentary basi..'1J.s of
India for evaluating petroleum
genero.ting conditions and petroleum source-qmlity (Punja.b,
Ga.ngo., RD.jnsthe..n, Sanchor, Vin~, Godavari-Krishna, Palar,
J~dmon Nicobar Basin and Gondwnna Grabens).

The project has been ~~en
up as priority project No,S
in collaboration with I'I ~
Madras. Supply orders for
purchase of the ro qn:i:rc d
imported/indigenous equipment, chemicals and glasswares have been plnced.
Available snmplos from the
Barntang fo~tion of J~damans
have boen collected.

Stuqy of relutions botweon chemicol composition of crude oils in
the CfU1lb~ and UppGr Assam Basins
wi th geology as clue to their
origins.

The project h..'1.S been taken up
as priority project No.9.
Action for procurement of
imported/indigenous equip.:
ment, chemicals and glasswares is in hand. Literature
survoy on tile relations between geology and chemical
composition of oils fran
d i ffercnt oountrie s has been
carried out.

Hydrogeological and hydrochemical
studies of all Indian Sedimentary
bas ins in :relati on tC" hydrooarbon
nigration and entrapment c onditiC'ns nnd prosorvation of oil,
gas accumulation.

The project bas been taken
up as priority project No.11.
Raquiremcnts of the indigenous
equipment, chemicals and
glnsswares were processed.
Some of the materials have
beon :received. Literature
survey in respect of organic
matters in uatcrs has been
carried out.

Ievelopment of computer sofiwarcs
to study processes of origin,
migrati0n and accumulation of
petroleum in Indian Sedimentary
basins.

The project has been tOken up
as priority project Nn. 12. A
programme for storage and
retrieval of geochemical data
for sedimentary organic matter has been prepared. Literature surv~ on the kinetics of ~drocarbon
genGr~tion under different
geothermal c andi tions has
been made.
