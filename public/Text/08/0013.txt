including Chief Executives in ROD, through courses, visits and
seminars is necessary.

ROO and Export
In many industries, an effective ROO organisation cannot be

supported if its output is solely directed towards application
in India.

This is beccuse, often, the volume Rnd value of goods

and improvements arising within the country from such technology
would not be commensurate with the expenditure on ROO and technology
development.

Adequate volume can be obtained by sale of product

or of technology outside the country.
Import of technology should be confined as far as possible
to such organisations that have the necessary absorptive capacity.
In the case of major enterprises this will mean that a viable ROD
system should be available \n the enterprise.

In the case of small

scale enterprises cooperative ROD institutions will need to be
evolved in order to create the necessary absorptive c2pacities.
