The project has been taken up as priority project No. 22. Discussi~ns have
been held with !JGRI, Hyderabad, regarding their collaboration in fabricati~n
of pressure cells and asSOCiated pressure-temperature generating and measuring sys toms. TIle NGRI arc yet to
submit their terms and conditi0ns for
the cnllaborntion. Literature survey
~d theoretical studies on tho expected
behaviour of rook properties with
pressure and temperature has been
atteoptod.
