The third category of sm2ll entrepreneurs are those
totclly unconnected with the public sector enterprises, located
in

t~~

noighbourhood of tho

~yblic

soctor

enter~rise.

There may

be no analytical 2nd testing facilities on ROD institutions
in the noighbourhood.

In such cases th8 public sector enterpri-

ses can actively essist the small scale entrepreneurs in the
neighbourhood for providing various testing and analytical
facilities and also assisting them in small research and devolopment projects as long as such work does not become a substantial
burden on the public enterprises and does not detract the public
sector enterprise from its normal course of activities.
Assistance to small scale entrepreneurs will be a continuing effort and will be a natural outcome of ostablishing an
appropriate ROO effort within the public enterprises.

A senior

scientist from the ROO laboratory attached to the Public Sector
Enterprises could be nominated as a contact scientist for a small
scale industry in a m2nner similar to what has been suggested in
the earlier paragraphs relating to Cooperation with National
Laboratories.
