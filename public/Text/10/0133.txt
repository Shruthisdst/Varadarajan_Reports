bearing,

aromatics and

such other plants that were of high social status and could also
be used for wo!ship purposes.
In this context one has to remember that high deensi ty of

trees

in

the

vicinity

substantially

lowers

the

ambient

temperature inside the building itself which, in its turn reduces
the

general

humidity

of

the

building

its

and

immediate

sttrroundings. In other words, by greening the surroundings with
trees we in the long run achieve the object of reduced monument
humidity;

provide

shade

to

the

visitors

and

beautify

the

:surroundings, thus underlining the fact that tourist facilities
and- aesthetic

comfort need not

corne

into

conf lict

with monument conservation. All such factors can be combined and
converged to attain both the ends successfully.
We would like to.underline that Changed society of today has

in building use necesitate serious change in our attitude towards
surroundings and its planning to help the complex breath properly

In fact such a monstrous idea involves removal of 5,17,778 trees
already growing for more than about three decades. 1
