As the idea Qf flood-lighting the monumental buildings has
come to us from the Occident, i.e from the USA and Europe, it is
worthwhile- to look into the concrete natural conditions of
the Occident and of India as the two settings seriously differ in
natural conditions surrounding the buildings themselves. In India
these lighting practices have been transplanted through simple
exacutive pressures,

orders and fiats but without any serious

regard to differences in the natural conditions. This neglect of
natural

reality during decision making

is

leading

to

serious

consequences which are either non-exiscant or extremely marginal
in the Occident.
Apparant Reason For Flood-lighting In contemporary India
The concept of flood-lighting of monuments has never been
part of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) norms and practices
since its. very inception under the British colonial rule.

Even

places like Gateway Of India in Bombay, India Gate at New Delhi
and Victoria Memorial in Calcutta, for example, were never floodlit.

These

buildings

were

normaly

well

lighted

ceremonialy and decoratively lighted only for a

and

were

few days in a

year as rare exceptional occasions under the British whose
imperial occupation these monuments, along with a number of forts
at various Presidencies and Residencies,

symbolised.

Flood-

lighting of Viceregal Lodge of the olden days of the Empire was
not a norm even on ceremonial occasions. Absence of such practice
from the British norms was obviously not due to lack of funds.
AS! monuments under olden norms were closed and put out of
bound for visi tors

from sunset to sunr ise.
