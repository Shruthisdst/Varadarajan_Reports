-6£"A Vision uniting Heritage and People n
Preface
~t is th~ fanel'~ hope that b~ the year 2020 the City of Agra
and ~ts env~rons w~ll be accla~med for the unique cultural
experience it provides visitors and the quality of life which it
affords for all its residents. If this vision is to be fulfilled it
is ~perative that action be taken now. The need is urgent. If
neglected any longer, the city will continue to deteriorate and the
integrity of Agra's World Heritage sites will vanish.

A first step to

~e

taken is the designation now of Agra as a
World Heritage City. Mathura, Bharatpur, Fatehpur Sikri and
Vrindaban must ~e included within a larger heritage region in the
future. The pan~l is aware that the term ttTaj Trapezium" has been
used to define this region but notes that the term lacks precision
find I.lay not be broadly understood. The Pilnel used the tPrInS World
Heritage Sit~, World Heritage City and the Agra Heritage Region
during its discussions. Designation of Agra as a World. Heritage
City would attract widespread interest and support; intellectual
and financial a9 well as technical.

themselves. Massive resources will be required.
The citizens of Agra must be included in the process from the
outset, for without their active participation at all stages, the
conservation and future development of Agra as a Heritage City will
fail. A special effort must be made to involve those with knowledge
~f the rich past of the city, especially in the areas of music,
arts and crafts.
Public awakening through education will be necessary to convey
to each new generation knowledgi~ of the city I s history I of the
importance of its monuments ar.d a\·;ar(;ness of the econo:nic and
social benefits of maintaining their legacy as a World Heritage
City. The cooperation of Agra's c~tizcns is viL~l to ~h~
achievereent of the goals sought by the Panel. Poor people cannac
