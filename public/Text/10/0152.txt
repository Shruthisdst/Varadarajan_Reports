well known todayu. Secondly, the animals being the top of herbivor-ous atld catruvourous

Tigers and elephants are not new to India. They- have a presellC%
that-goes back to the dawn of Indus Valley clvillzatlon J '. Most of tlus
terntory is at present devoid of these animals. In .Medieval pellod there
are two very authcntl~ reports of personal encounters WIth another extinct
aOlmal) rhmoceros, pointing to very diff:rent type of forest that is a logical
compulsion of the fact. Ibn Batluta" and Baburll leave no doubts
about the presence of Jt in Multan area. It has also been reported in the
'VlcmilY of Jaunpur as late as the 17th century11. This fact implies
dense, humid and subtropical to tropical, permanently green (orests with
high humidIty and probably sub-soil water table l ' Without which rhino
is not likely to survive in nature". This illustration makes it clear that
not only the forests have disappeared from this area but the presence of
~uch animals as rhino indicate~ that the type of dominant forest that
1:xisted then, has also undergone a sca-change. PreSence of elephants and
tigers in nature not only indIcates the presence of forest but poitlu to the
possible forest type if taken with other colateral and concomitant fact
including inferences and observations of modem biology.
Modern authorities have it" that .he ti~r has its origin in Man ..
