Within the four day period available the Panel has sought to
assess the current status of the Agra region's World Heritage
Sites, to learn of their condition and of plans for their further
conservation and development. The Panel also met with sei-tior
officials responsible for the implementation of the next stages in
the development of the Agra Heritage Region.
The Panel and the concerned Agra officials agreed that a
holistic approach to the conservation of the Agra Heritage Region
was required. This recognizes the unsurpassed international
significance of the Taj Mahal and the priority of Agra as a
Heritage City. By conceptualizing an overall regional vision, the
Panel intends to give appropriate prominence to Mathura, Vrindaban
and Bharatpur as well as Agra Fort, Sikandra, Fatehpur Sikri and
the Taj Mahal.
with support of both Indian and u.s. professionals who have
been associated with aspects of the work undertaken under the Agra
Heritage Project since 1987, the Panel sought a broad understanding
~f the state of planning and of conservation activities related to
~he monuments and the development of infrastructure essenlial to
the future of Agra. The Panel recognized from t~e outset t:hr:t it
would be unrealist5.. c to suppose that a detailed visivI1 C0UJ d be
formulated,
justified ana articulated during the shol.t Lime
available to the Panel.

range of the scientific and technical work undertaken since 1987
under the aegis of the u.s. National Park Service in cooperation
with the Agra Development Authority, the Archeological Survey of
India and the Ministry of Tourism. Despite presentations made und
documents reviewed, the Panel was troubled by the absence of a
coherent strategy linking various
agency and institutional
objectives into an over-arching vision of desired outcomes for the
~gra
Heritage Region. The Panel was informed that the Agra
Development Authority has insufficient authority and resources to
implement a comprehensive plan for the region. A single authority
to plan, coordinate and implement is needed.
h~.ndicap?ed

Thus, the Panel has not found it easy to relate its
recommendation to a broad regional framework. We were unable to
fully ilccess and utilize the kno-.:lcdge, expe:::-ience <:lnd p:)st
planning which would have permit ted U~ to asses the ':"mplicat.~o!1s eJi
alternative proposals for an updatec.~ Agra Development Plan. wi:'hcu+.:
a clear spatial strategy and a careful articulation of the short,
middle and long-term goals under.lying such a plan it has not proven
feilsible to und~rt i-e an evalua ticn of the mer its of indi v iduill
proposals, albeit many suggested appear both sound and feasible.
