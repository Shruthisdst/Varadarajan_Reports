It is to be noted that in his footnote to the English translation of the
Ain, 1813, Blochman mentions the fact that by that time elephants were
already extmct from the territory me!ltJoned by Abul Fazl in the Ain.

time of c::ompl\attOn of the Ain an thl~ terntory was cleared of th\s species.
It IS of snterest to note that Jehangeer goes on record to descnbe an
elephant huntmg expedition in the Ma!wa reglon in the VlciOlty of Madu
towards Dohad, and, in spIte of mismanagement, manages to catch two
